         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Why <hi>Herod,</hi> you might at parting bid me adieu with tears; you might look upon as you have done, with eyes wherein I ſaw but ſignes of Affection; and at the ſame time meditate my death. Ah! If you could (which I doubt not) you might verie well alſo to day, feigne that you believe me culpable to make me die Innocent. And tell me not as a favour, that this command was the effect of the ſtrong paſſion you had for me: the death of the perſon beloved can never be a Teſtimonie of Affection.

Nevertheleſs, behold, all the Teſtimonies of good wil that he has got from me: no bodie ſales that we have had too private correſpondence together: No bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſaies he hath come often to my appartments; and in fine, I have done nothing for him, but what his moſt cruel enemie might have done, if they had known the ſame thing: ſurlie I ſhould have rewarded him ill to tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at him thus.

The erimes of others gives them ſo much horrour, that they are never more ſtronglic confirmed in good, then when they ſee evil committed: and for me, I think I ſhould have been leſs innocent, if you had been leſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt.

It may be he will anſwer, that ſince he had no deſign to do the deed, but on the contrare to adveriſe you, he did not think of a reward. But I can ſay to that impoſtore, that not to give me reaſon of ſuſpecting him, he alwayes accepted what I offered to him: And that alſo not having ſpoken, and not being able to ſhow, is a ſtrong and convincing perſwaſion of his lie: for in fine, Gold is the Complice of all Crimes and Hope is the onlie Portion of great Spirits: But for the Baſe and Mercenarie, they muſt be moved by the ſight of a certain reward; otherwaies that ſort of People will not ſerve you: And too manie Examples of your Reign, should have taught you what I ſay. Yet though it be true, that it cannot be made appear, that either I or mine, have had anie dealing with that man, it is not ſo of <hi>Salome</hi> your heart and my enemie.

And moreover, in what place have I taken poiſon; who prepared it? from whence cauſed I bring it? And wherefore, if I had ſuch intentiones, was it neceſſar to have emploied that man: was is not eaſie for me, when we have eat ſo manie times together; to have poiſoned you with my own hand, without truſting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

For as I ſaid in the beginning of my diſcourſe, it is neither fear of death, nor deſire of life, that makes me ſpeak to day. The firſt prepares Crowns for me, and the other can give me nothing but troubles. It is not then hope of eſcaping from the danger I am in, that makes me take care to juſtifie my ſelf: I know my ſentenee is ſigned my Executioners are readie to ſtrik off my head, and that my Tomb is alreadie opened to receive me: But that which moved me to it, was to the end, that all who hear me, may let Poſterity know, that my verie ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies could not with all their malice, ſtain the vertue of <hi>Mariamne:</hi> Nor find a plauſible pretext for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning her.

And though my eyes had ſometimes gained famous Victories, and could have counted among their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives <hi>Caeſares</hi> and <hi>Halph</hi> gods: Yet I truſted not to their Charmes, I ſuſpected my beautie at that time; I thought it had not force enough to conquer you: And as you was the moſt Magnificent of all men, I did not wiſh that love ſhould take poſſeſſion of your heart, but by Magnificencie: And that the day of its Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:31892:21"/>
               <p>I deſired to daſle your eyes then by the beautie of my Armes: for if you remember, My dear <hi>Anthonie,</hi> the firſt day that I ſay you, I ſhinned in a ſhip, whoſe Poupe was all of Gold, the ſails Purpell, and the oares Silver, which by their Equall Cadence, imitated the ſound of diverſe inſtruments concording together. I was under a Pavilion or wrought Gold, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Birth was divine, becauſe you are deſcended of <hi>Hercules,</hi> you are not ignorant, that I had a Veſture like that which is given to <hi>Venus.</hi> All my Women were Splendidlie Cloathed as Nymphes: and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Cupidons round about me: Were alſo an effect of the deſire I had to overcome you; For in fine, My dear <hi>Anthony,</hi> that little Armour was only made againſt you.</p>
               <p>It was not then without deſign that I overcame you: I employed all things to that end: And nothing that Beautie, Skill, or Magnificencie could do was fogot at that time. I know verie well it is imprudence, to ſpeak to you of all thoſe things, in a time ſo differing from the felicitie of that: but that day was ſo glo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ious to me, that I can never loſs the memorie of it: And moreover, to ſpeak Rationallie, that Remembrance is not unprofitable for my Vindication. For to think any way, that I my ſelf would loſs my conqueſts? ſuch thoughts never entered in the minde of any Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: Certainlie <hi>Alexander</hi> would have rather choſen to loſs <hi>Macedonia</hi> then <hi>Perſia:</hi> That Kingdom was his Fathers Eſtate; But this was truelie his own: And by the ſame Reaſon, I would have rather loſt my ſelf then loſt you. You know alſo if I be not miſtaken that I was no ſevere Conquereſs: the Chains I gave you were of no weight: my Lawes had nothing of Rudneſs in them: and in the manner I uſed you, it had been hard to know, who was Victorious.</p>
               <p>Since that, what have I done <hi>Anthonie,</hi> to make me be ſuſpected? It is true I forgot my own Glorie, but it was for love of you. Yes, I have ſuffered my ſelf to be opprobriated in <hi>Rome:</hi> and although the pride of your Country, that treats all ſtrangers like <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and all Queens (like ſlaves) hindered me from being your Wife, the affection which I have for your Perſon is ſo ſtrong, that I have not left off to be yours. Yes, <hi>Anthonie,</hi> I loved you more then my honor, and more
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:31892:22"/>then my life: I thought it could not be unjuſt to love a man worthie of being ranked among the gods: And that the Paſſion which I had in my Soul, had ſo noble a cauſe, that it would render me excuſable: ſo that without conſidering what misfortuns were prepared for me, I have moſt conſtantlie loued you, ever ſince the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ſt day that I gave you my promiſe. Judge from that if I had power to betray you, or to ſpeak bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter if I would betray my ſelf. It is true, I fled, but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Anthonie,</hi> if I took the flight it was for love of you, I ſlighted the Victorie to preſerve your life: And your perſon was dearer to me, then your glorie or my own.</p>
               <p>I Well ſee that this Diſcourſe Aſtoniſhes and ſurpriſes you. But for your comprehenſion, permit me to tell what condition my Soul was in, when in the mideſt of the Fight, I ſaw you all covered with Darts and Flams. The death which I ſaw in ſo manie places made me apprehenſive of yours: all the Enemies Javelines ſeemed by me to addreſs themſelves againſt you: And, in the manner, that my imagination repreſented the affair to me, I thought all <hi>Ceſars</hi> Armie deſired to fight none but <hi>Anthonie.</hi> I manie times fancied that I ſaw you dragged by force into the enemies veſſalls, or fall dead at their feet.</p>
               <p>And although thoſe who were round about me, aſſured me, that I was deceived by my eyes, and that the Victorie was ſtill uncertain; What did I not ſay in thoſe fatal moments? And what grief did I not feel? Ah! my dear <hi>Anthonie,</hi> did you but know the ſorrows of a Soul, that ſees the Perſon beloved everie minute in hazard of dying; you would find it the moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible torment, thar can ever be indured. My heart received all the blows which were aimed at you; I was captive everie time, I thought you ſo, and death it ſelf hath nothing ſo rude, as what I ſuffered at that time. In that deplorable condition, I found no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie for my grief: and my imagination uſing greater Ingenuitie for my Perſecution; after having perſwaded me that all the enemies deſired your death, immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie perſwaded me, that they reſolved to preſerve your life, thereby to make themſelves Maſters of your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie. The firſt thought did certainlie give me a little
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:31892:22"/>eaſe: But the image of <hi>Ceſars</hi> Triumph, preſenting it ſelf all at once to me, I relapſed into my former deſpaire. It was not, my dear <hi>Anthonie,</hi> that I believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you capable of following a Conquerours Charriot: But I thought that to ſhune that ſupream misfortune, you would have recourſe to death: So that whatever way it was, I alwayes found my ſelf equallie unhappie. I bethought me of what poiſon I ſhould choice that I might follow you: And there is no fatall Reſolution which paſt not in my minde I thought more then twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie times to caſt my ſelf into the Sea, to free me from the agonie I was in: Yet becauſe I could not die with out forſaking you, I could not purſue that deſign.</p>
               <p>But coming of a ſudden to conſider the ſtrong Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which you alwaies teſtified to me, I thought if you ſhould ſee me abandon the armie, you would alſo forſake it &amp; by that found I the meanes of preſerving your life, and libertie together. For (ſaid I to my ſelf, after framing that Reſolution) <hi>Ceſar</hi> doth not ſeek Victorie ſo much, as the life or libertie of <hi>Anthonie:</hi> And upon condition that he have neither the one nor the other, I ſhall be glad to loſs the Battle. In fine, my dear <hi>Anthonie,</hi> I did what my affection and deſpair councelled me to do: And you did what I expected from your love I had no ſooner ſeen, you quit your Ship, and take a Galley to follow me: but my heart was ſea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Judge then if that could be the action of a Criminall; For if I had deſigned to be ſeparated from you, it was eaſie for me not to have received you: Becauſe I had ſixtie ſail, and you had but one ſingle Galley. If I had betrayed you I might have eaſilie delivered you unto <hi>Ceſars</hi> hands: And by that given him truelie the Victorie.</p>
               <p>If I had eſſaied to rank my ſelf on the enemies ſide; if the flight which I took, might have been ſuſpicious to you; I ſhall ſay your ſuſpicions are lawfull: But on the contrare, my flight having been the effect of my deſpair and love you ſhould complain of fortune and not accuſe <hi>Cleopatra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Further, do not imagine, that that Victorie ſhall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be verie Glorious to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> or your retrait ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to you; You fled not from your enemies, you but followed <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> Your Souldiers were conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Ceſar,</hi> but you was onlie by love. If this Battle had been the firſt occaſion of War, wherein you had been found, your Valior might have been queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned: but it is ſo Univerſallie known, that none are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of it. There are almoſt no People, among whom you have not given proof of your courage in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of your Youth: And certainlie you muſt have given manie, becauſe the great <hi>Julius Ceſar</hi> choiſe you to command the left wing of his armie, in the famous Battle of <hi>Pharſalia;</hi> and in a day whereon the conqueſt of the Empire of all the World depended.</p>

And moreover, our affairs are not yet deſperate: you have a ſtrong Armie near <hi>Actium,</hi> which is not yet under <hi>Ceſars</hi> Colours: My Kingdoms have alſo men, monie, &amp; fortified places: and I wiſh that, all my Subjects may loſs to the laſt drop of their blood to preſerve yours and your libertie. But in fine, when fortune ſhall unjuſtlie take from you theſe Crowns, which your merit, and valiour have gained by force: Know that <hi>Cleopatras</hi> love ſhall not diminiſh. No my dear <hi>Anthonie,</hi> when that enemie of Illuſtrious Perſons, ſhall reduce us to live under a Cotage of Straw, in ſome place remote from the Societie of the World; I ſhal have for you the ſame paſſion, that I had in that bleſſed hour, wherein you gave Kingdoms: And wherein twentie two Kings were to be ſeen in your Train. Think not then that misfortune can fright me: there is but one which I can never ſuffer with you: And doubtleſs which you alſo will not endure. Yes, <hi>Cleopatra</hi> can be exiled with <hi>Anthonie</hi> and not complain: She can Renounce all the Splendour of Royalitie, and yet preſerve her deſires of life, but bondage is that which ſhe can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver endure, and which ſhe knows you will not ſuffer no more then ſhe. Be then aſſured, that ſo far from hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intelligence with <hi>Ceſar,</hi> I give you my promiſe, to die rather then truſt to him, or put my ſelf in hazard of ſerving his Triumph.</p>

But before we come to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream remedie, let us do all things to reſiſt our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Let us preſerve life ſo long as we can without ſhame: For in fine, it ſhould not be indifferent to us, while we love each other perfectlie. My dear <hi>Anthonie</hi> I perceive, me thinks by your eyes, that my diſcourſe hath not been unprofitable: They tell me that your heart repents, of having unjuſtlie ſuſpected me; That it ſees my innocencie as pure as it is; and that the love it has for me is ſo great, that it forebears not yet to love the perſon, who robbed your hands of the Victorie. For me, my dear <hi>Anthonie,</hi> you ſhall alwayes be my ſtrongeſt and laſt paſſion; I do acknowledge, that in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:31892:24"/>the time I did not know you, <hi>Julius Ceſars</hi> glorie did touch my heart: And that I could not hinder my ſelf from loving a man, who over all the Earth, paſſed for the firſt or Mortals. A man (I ſay) whom you formerlie judged worthie the Empire of all the World: Becauſe you gave him his firſt honour, by putting a Diadem upon his head in the middle of <hi>Rome,</hi> and who after his death, by a brave and Heroick Oration which you made to the <hi>Roman</hi> People, cauſed him be ſet up amongſt the gods: Who chaſed <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſſius;</hi> burned their Places; And <hi>Signaliſed</hi> your Courage and Friend ſhip.</p>
               <p>But ſince the time I have ſeen you, I can aſſure you, that you have ſoveraignlie reigned in my Soul; and ſhall reign there continuallie. It is an Empire which fortune hath not given you, and which being without its domination, ſhall ever be yours in ſpight of its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice. It may overturn Kingdoms and Empires, but it ſhall never change my heart: And whatever doth uſuallie deſtroy the ſtrongeſt affections, ſhall but fortifie mine. And to teſtifie to you, that I can love better then you, I will not ſuſpect your Friendſhip of anie weakneſs. Yes <hi>Anthonie,</hi> I do believe that although <hi>Cleopatra</hi> hath cauſed all your misfortunes, ſhe ſhall ever make all your happineſs: and that without repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you of having ever loved her, ſhe ſhall alwayes reign in your heart, as you do in hers. Let us go then my dear <hi>Anthonie,</hi> Let us go to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> to do our laſt Endeavours, to conquer thoſe who have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come us: it is there where perhaps we ſhal yet find where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall to ſubdue the inſolence of our enemies.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:31892:27"/>upon as the field of Battle? Where your great Heart ſeemed equallie to defie death and fortune, and where you Surmounted both. In fine, <hi>Alexander,</hi> there may be everie where found Teſtimonies of your Valour and Conqueſts; Wherefore, without ſpeaking to you, I content my ſelf with praiſing your Clemencie and Goodneſs. But, what do I ſay? Thoſe two Vertues are as Generallie known as your courage: for if, as I have alreadie ſaid, you are Maſter and conqueror of all men; It may be alſo ſaid that you are all mens Benefactor.</p>
               <p>It will be ſaid that the gods have remitted into your hands all the favours they uſed to beſtow; That they have eſtabliſhed you to be the diſtributor of good deeds; And that they have given you Commiſſion to make all the World happie. You do no ſooner Conquer a Kingdom, but you give it: your enemies are no ſooner your Subjects, but they become your friends: And you not ſooner Conquer them, but you become their Protector.</p>
               <p>I have ſo famous an example in my Perſon of what I ſay, that I cannot doubt it without being Criminall. For, O Invincible <hi>Alexander!</hi> I ſhall never forget the favours I have received from you:</p>
               <p>Yes, I ſhall alwaies remember that diſmal-day, wherein my Daughter and I became your Priſoners: Fear of bondage had poſſeſt our Spirits with ſuch horrid Viſions that death appeared the greateſt happineſs that could befall us. We had loſt the Battle with the Throne; we believed <hi>Darius</hi> alreadie loſt; And that which was moſt inſupportable to us, was, we thought that we ſhould be neceſſitated, to die by our own hands, to ſhun the Inſolence of the Conquerors.</p>
               <p>But alace! I did not then know <hi>Alexander;</hi> For, ſaid I to my ſelf, I am Mother of the greateſt of his Enemies, becauſe <hi>Darius</hi> is the moſt powerfull of all them who reſiſted him: And judging of you by the reſt, I feared you as much then, as I love you now. This unjuſt fear was of no continuance in my minde: the ſight of you quicklie diſſipated it, and I alſo remember, the firſt time, I had the honor of ſeeing you. You pardoned me a fault. For becauſe I did no know you, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the trouble I was in, gave me not libertie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Reaſon well on the matter, you know I took the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:31892:28"/>
                  <hi>Ephiſtion</hi> for you: And that without being angrie? you ſaid to me, <hi>that I was not miſtaken, becauſe he was the ſecond Alexander.</hi> That ſign of Moderation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, and of Friendſhip towards your Favorite, began to give me juſter thoughts of you: And to remitt in my Soul that hope which fear had chaſed from it. And ſurlie you alſo to day does well teſtifie, that <hi>Ephiſtion</hi> is as dear to you as your ſelf: Becauſe having deſigned to Marrie the Eldeſt of my Daughters your ſelf, you gave the other to this ſecond <hi>Alexander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since that, what have you not done for me? You have not onlie treated me as a Queen, though I was Captive; But you have treated me as your Mother, and you have done me the favour alwaies to call me ſo. Everie time that anie new Subject of grief did befall me, you have had the goodneſs to Solace me; I have ſeen you in conſideration of me weep for your Victories; I have ſeen you Regrate <hi>Darius</hi> his Death; I have ſeen you carefull of his Funeralls and Tomb; I have ſeen you expoſe your life to Revenge his death; I have ſeen you puniſh the Traitor <hi>Beſſus</hi> who did aſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſine him; I have ſeen you reward them who were faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to him; And I ſee you alſo this day reſtore <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> to the Throne, by placing there his Daughter and mine.</p>
               <p>But the moſt wonderfull of all the Actions that I have ſeen you do for <hi>Darius;</hi> Is that I have ſome times ſeen this <hi>Alexander</hi> Conqueror of the Univerſs, have ſo much Vertue, as not to truſt to his own: And not to expoſe himſelf to the eyes of <hi>Darius</hi> his Wife, fearing leaſt he ſhould be Conquered by her beautie.</p>
               <p>Ah! After all this it muſt certainlie be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that all that can be ſaid of you is far below your merit: you have both together the chaſtitie of my Sex, and the Vertues of all the <hi>Heroes,</hi> who have onlie preceeded you in age.</p>
               <p>There can be no good qualities which are not to be found in your Perſon in the higheſt degree: And it may be ſaid that Vertues are Perfectionated in your Soul, and take a new luſter. That which is Temeritie in anie other, is but ſimple Effect of your courage, and exceſſe of good cannot be vicious in you. You give profuſelie, and yet without prodigalitie: Becauſe
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:31892:28"/>you do not onlie proportionat the preſents you make to them who receives them, but to him who gives them.</p>
               <p>So that, Townes, whole Provinces, Millions of Gold, Scepters and Crowns, are things which <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> can give without being Prodigall: For as he has received more favours from Heaven then anie other; it is alſo he ſhould give more then all others. This truth is ſo well known to you, and you practiſe it ſo perfectlie; That after having Conquered all the World, and having given it almoſt whollie to diverſe Perſons; when you have been ſometimes asked what you would Reſerve for your ſelf; You have anſwered, <hi>Hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And truelie I have often wondered to ſee, that you no ſooner had anie thing in your power, but you did put it in that of an other: And nevertheleſs, you deſiſted not to be alwaies giving. This Reflection made me think, that <hi>Alexander</hi> might be ſaid to be like the Sea, which no ſooner receives in its Vaſt Breaſt the Tribute which all the Fountains, the Rivers and the Floods carrie to it, but it renders it with Uſurie to ſome other part of the World.</p>
               <p>What ſhe takes from the <hi>Perſians,</hi> ſhe gives back to the <hi>Greecks;</hi> The Ship wracks which ſhe makes does not enrich her; She makes no bodie poor but to augment ſome others fortune; And without keeping anie thing either of what is given her, or of what ſhe Uſurpes; She alwaies rolles her Vawes with an equall Motion. Juſt ſo is it with things that you receive from the Gratitude of your Subjects, of the tributes they pay to you, or of the Conqueſts you make.</p>
               <p>You receive them with one hand, and gives them with the other: The verie booties which you take from your Enemies, does but make Rich your Souldiers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> So that, be it in Peace, or in war, during a Tempeſt, or during a Calme, you equallie do good to all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing anie to your ſelf.</p>
               <p>Yet there is this difference, between the Ocean and you, that all which goes from the Sea returnes to it, but what goes from your hands never comes back to them again. Further, it ſhall be glorious for you to ſee People in your Hiſtorie, who have refuſed your
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:31892:29"/>gifts, becauſe you gave too much: And that there ſhall be none found Complaining that you gave too little. Your liberalitie is ſo much the more Execllent, in that it is not blind. You do good to all the World, but you do it not alwaies without choice.</p>
               <p>All the daies of your life are not thoſe of Donationes to the People, where without diſtinction, you throw Treaſures among the crowd: Where the happie on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie have the advantage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Diſciple knows better how to uſe Riches; and knows better how liberalitie muſt be practiſed. Yes <hi>Alexander,</hi> You have reconcilled Fortune with Vertue: We ſee Philoſophers, Poets, Muſicians, Limners, and Sculptors in abundance, and yet do not work but onlie for your Glorie and their own.</p>
               <p>We ſee (I ſay) Philoſophers practiſe that Policie which they teach in Governing great Kingdoms; We ſee Poëts carrie at once a Harp of Gold, and a Quiver of Ibonie; To ſing your Triumphes, and command your Provinces. We ſee Muſicians, whoſe Luttes are of Ivorie; Who emploie not their voices, but to praiſe you, and to ſpeak of your felicitie. We ſee Limners as Rich as the Mightie Princes have been formerlie, who emploied them to work. We ſee Sculptors, not onlie make uſe of Marble, Alabaſter, and Porphire in their ſtatues; but have Palaces of their own, where all thoſe things are ſeen.</p>
               <p>In fine, all good Sciences and all good Arts, flouriſh under your reign. Alſo it ſhall be ſaid, that as the gods have made a Miracle of you, Nature was likewaies deſirous to make its chiefeſt works for love of you. You have <hi>Ariſtotleſs, Xenophanteſs, Apelleſs</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cippeſs,</hi> who owing their felicitie and Glorie to you, ſhall alſo beſtow their Labour upon yours. All future Ages that ſhal ſee the pictures which theſe Famous men will leave of you, either by their writings, or by their tablets, or by their ſtatues, ſhall doubtleſs envie that of the great <hi>Alexander.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All the Vertues of that time ſhall wiſh to have been in this. You ſhall be the <hi>Modell</hi> of great Pinces, and the foil of perverſe: And while there ſhall be men, you ſhall be ſpoken of as a god. I certainlie wonder an more, that our great <hi>Xerxes</hi> with all his power
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:31892:29"/>could not perfect what deſigns he had conceived: For ſince <hi>Greece</hi> ought to Educate you: The gods had reaſon to preſerve the Conqueſt of the World for you. If <hi>Xerxes</hi> had accompliſhed his enterpriſe, perhaps he ſhould have been called the Tyrran and whip of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe: But for you, you are the <hi>Legitimate</hi> Prince of all the People whom you have Conquered. You are ſent from Heaven for the Worlds felicitie: And there was juſt Subject for <hi>Hamnon</hi> the Oracle of <hi>Jupiter</hi> to ſay, <hi>That you was his Son, and was Invincible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No <hi>Alexander,</hi> none can exceed you, neither in War nor in Vertue: And after the deſign you have made to day, of replacing <hi>Darius</hi> on the the Throne by dividing it with his Daughter <hi>Statira:</hi> There is nothing more remains for you to do, and nothing more for me to wiſh, but the Continuance of your Glorie. It is not that I fear it can be taken from you: No, there is no ſuch thought in my mind: But I fear that mens unjuſtice will render them unworthie of having you long for their Maſter: Or that the gods jealous of our happineſs recall you to themſelves. If which come to paſs, I do aſſure you, O invincible <hi>Alexander!</hi> not to ſtay in the World after you: I could live after <hi>Darius,</hi> who was my Son; But after all the Obligations which I have had from you, I ſhall not ſurvive <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander.</hi> I had not told you, ſuch ſad thoughts in a day of rejoicing, if I had not believed that it would be advantageous to you, that it ſhould be known there was a Princeſs, that there was (I ſay) a Mother, and if I dare ſay a Vertuous Mother, who without baſeneſs, and without unjuſtice, hath loved you better then her own Son, though you was her enemie. Pardon me then ſo dolefull a thought, becauſe it is Glorious to you: And believe that when my wiſhes are exhauſted, not onlie ſhall your Glorie be immortall, but likewaies your Perſon.</p>

But ſince this is the laſt time, perhaps that I ſhall ever ſee You, I ſhall joyfullie tell You what have alwaies been my ſentiments: To the end, that by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I ſhall give You, of that averſion which I ever had to bondage, You may be the more eaſilie induced, to think of my Libertie. How ſoon I had opened my eies to the light, the firſt thing I learned, was that there Were a People, who without anle right, but what the ſtrong impoſes upon the weak, would make themſelves Maſters of all others: And while my infancie laſted. I heard no diſcourſe but of the <hi>Roman</hi> Triumphs; Of Kings whom they had chained; Of famous Captives which they had made; Of the Miſeries of theſe unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate men; And of all the things that are done in thoſe fatal Spectales, where the <hi>Romans</hi> pride makes up the Nobleſt fruit of the Victorie.</p>
               <p>Thoſe images were ſo earlie Imprinted in my mind, that nothing could ever baniſh them thence. Since I
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:31892:32"/>became more Reaſonable by age, I have had more Averſion for that <hi>Roman</hi> Eagle; which ſees nothing but the rapines it makes: And which flies not above the heads of Kings, but to take off their Crowns. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it will be ſaid to me, that the <hi>Romans</hi> give ſo manie Kingdoms as they Uſurpe? And that they make as manie Kings as they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> to their Chariot.</p>
               <p>But my dear <hi>Maſſiniſſa,</hi> if you will rightlie Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the buſineſs, You wil find that they give, no Scepters, but to have the more famous ſlaves: And that if they put Crowns upon their Vaſſals heads, it is but to have the pleaſure of ſeeing them laid at their feet; becauſe that by their orders, they will have hommage payed to them.</p>
               <p>Vanitie is the Soul of that Nation: It is its onlie work: It is but for it that it makes Conqueſts; Uſurpes Kingdomes; Deſolates all the World; And unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in being abſolutlie Miſtris of all that great Part of the Univerſe, which is of its Continent; Paſſes the Seas to come and Diſturb our Repoſe.</p>
               <p>For if onlie a deſire of augmenting its Confines, and encreaſſing its riches, cauſed it make War, it would be content to overturn Thrones, and putting them to death who Lawfullie Poſſeſſed them. But becauſe pride is their cheif inſtigator; A ſimple Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> muſt for his Glorie, and for the Peoples diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement, Drag Kings chained after his Triumphing Chariot. O Gods! Is it poſſible that Conqueros can be ſo inhumane! Is it poſſible to find Conquered Kings ſo cowardlie to endure ſuch cruell Uſage? Yes, without doubt, and too manie examples of this kind, have made it known, that all Princes are not Generous.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs it is certain, that <hi>Irons</hi> and Crowns, Scepters and Chains, are things which ſhould never be ſeen together: A Chaire drawn by <hi>Elephants,</hi> ſhould not be followed by Kings; And by Kings tied like Criminall, with whom no ſigns of Royaltie are left, but to ſignaliſe their ſhame, and the Glorie of their Conqueror. But what Glorie can he have who Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs in this ſort? For if theſe whom he has over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come are baiſe, (as there is great appearance becauſe they live:) It is no juſt Subject of vanitie to have outbrav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them.</p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:31892:33"/>
               <p>And if theſe unfortunate men, teſtified courage in their defaite; It is great inhumanitie in him who treats thus Princes who have done nothing, but defend their Crowns; Their Countrie; Their Wifes; Their Children; Their Subjects; And their Domeſtick-Gods.</p>
               <p>But if for the Glorie of their Conquerors, and for the Pleaſure of the People they would have Triumphs; It would be more Glorious for them, to cauſe carrie the Enemies armes whom they have killed with their own hands, then to have themſelves followed by Kings whom they have not fought. Chariots filled with broken armes, Bucklers, Launces, Javelins, and Standards taken from the Enemies; Would make a ſhow leſs Lamentable and more agreeable to the eies of the People.</p>
               <p>But Gods! Is it poſſible that Kings are deſtined for ſuch infamie? That theſe ſame People, who have Combates of <hi>Gladiators</hi> and of wild Beaſts given them for their divertiſement; Should alſo be the cauſe of ſuch fatall Ceremonie; And extract their pleaſure from the ignominie and misfortune of Kings; That it ſhould be, that they who delight in ſeeing four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, by a horrid brutalitie kill one another in one day; And who find their happineſs in ſeeing Tigers and Lyons devour each other; Is it poſſible (I ſay) that Kings opreſſed with Irons, ſhould be draged for theſe ſame People?</p>
               <p>For me, my dear <hi>Maſſiniſſa,</hi> I find ſomething ſo ſtrange in this ſort of Triumph, that I doubt if it be more diſgracefull to the Conquered, then to the Victorious; and in my particular, I know verie well, that I ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do the one nor the other. Judge then my dear <hi>Maſſiniſſa,</hi> if a perſon who would not enter <hi>Rome</hi> in a Triumphing Chariot, followed by a hunder chained Kings; Could reſolve to follow with Irons, that of the proud <hi>Scipio.</hi> No, <hi>Sophonisbas</hi> Soul is too great for that; If I were but a <hi>Carthaginean,</hi> I ſhall never be cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of it: If I were but <hi>Haſdrubals</hi> daughter, I ſhal never reſolve to do it: If I were but the Wife of the unfortunate <hi>Siphax,</hi> it is a weakneſs that ſhal never come in my mind: And If I were but the ſlave of the Illuſtrious <hi>Maſſiniſſa,</hi> I
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:31892:33"/>ſhall not follow anie other Conquerour. But being both together, a <hi>Carthaginean; Haſdruballs</hi> daughters; Wife to <hi>Siphax,</hi> and <hi>Maſſiniſſa,</hi> and Queen of two great Kingdoms: <hi>Scipio</hi> needs not think to make Triumph of <hi>Sophonisba.</hi> No, Generous <hi>Maſſiniſſa,</hi> if the chains they would give me were of Diamonds; And all the Irons Gliſter with Gold and precious Stones; And if they would aſſure me that I ſhould be immediatlie reſtored to the Throne, how ſoon I were untied from the Triumphant Chariot, I would chooſe death in prejudice of Royalltie: And if my hand ſhould once carrie Irons, I ſhould no more think it worthie to carrie a Scepter. In fine, I have ſo ſtrong an averſion for ſlaverie and bondage, and my Spirit is ſo delicate in ſuch matters, that if I thought <hi>Scipio</hi> would cauſe carrie my Picture in Triumph, I would pray you to put all the Limners of <hi>Numidea</hi> to death. But no, I condemn my ſelf for that thought: For if the inſenſible <hi>Scipio</hi> does carrie my Image in his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into <hi>Rome,</hi> he ſhall rather publiſh my Glorie then his own; It will be ſeen that I could die, when I could live no longer with honour: And that a Femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine courage ſurpaſſed the <hi>Roman</hi> Vanitie.</p>
               <p>I doubt not Generous <hi>Maſſiniſſa,</hi> if you do not with all your force oppoſe <hi>Scipios</hi> ſeveritie, but that you will be compelled to give me death, for acquitting you of your promiſe; For beſides the publick intereſt, there is alſo his own particular. He Remembers that his Father and Unckle are formerlie dead in <hi>Africa:</hi> He looks upon me as a fit victime to appeaſe their Ghoſts: And Joyning together in his heart, <hi>Romes</hi> Glorie and his own vengeance, it is not to be believed that <hi>Hasdruballs</hi> Daughter ſhall obtain her Libertie. Yet <hi>Generous <hi>Maſſiniſſa,</hi>
                  </hi> I think, it will be verie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, if in the ſame day wherein you Re-take the Crown of <hi>Numidea,</hi> your Wife ſhould be tied to a Triumphing Chariot: It is me thinks, to make you at once, a King and a Slave: Becauſe if (what you have ſaid to me be true) that my ſorrow and tears, added to the little beautie I have, hath touched your heart, and forced you to love me as much as your ſelf; This will be a Triumphing over you as well as
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:31892:34"/>me. Conſider well <hi>Maſſiniſſa,</hi> If you can be my Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator that day: Or if you will not think me unworthie of having done me the honor to Marrie me, if I ſhould be capable of diſgracing you ſo much: But do not fear that I ſhall expoſe you to ſuch ſorrow: If <hi>Scipio</hi> be inexorable, and you keep your promiſe to me, my death ſhall vindicat what choiſe you have made. How ever before we have recourſe to this laſt extreami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, do all you can to move the heart of that inſenſible Creature: Tell him I have whollie rendered my ſelf to you: That of all the bootie, which your Valour hath acquired to the <hi>Romans:</hi> You ask onlie one ſlave from them.</p>
               <p>But if his unjuſtice would oblidge you to deliver her into his hands, as if you were the meaneſt Souldier of his Legions; Tell him then that this ſlave is your Wife: And that ſhe cannot be made Triumph of without Triumphing over you: And that the Blood which you have loſt, in the ſervice of the <hi>Reipublick,</hi> deſerves their giving you Permiſſion to let her live in Freedom. Let him know that you have found her in your Kingdom, in your Palace, and upon your Throne: That in Reaſon ſhe belongs to you; And cannot be taken from you without injuſtice. But if theſe weightie Reaſons prevaill not, pray him tenderlie: And if at laſt you cannot make him flexible, Remember your promiſe, and fail not to keep it. I perceive by your eies, my dear <hi>Maſſiniſſa,</hi> that it will grieve you to preſent me with ſuch a lamentable gift: I well ſee (I ſay) that it will trouble you to ſend poiſon to her, to whom you have given a Diadem, your heart and libertie: I know that it is a rigid thought, and that it will be a doolefull ſight to you to ſee thoſe ſame Torches which gave light at my Marriage, muſt burn at my Funeralls: And that the ſame hand which you gave me in pledge of your faith, muſt be that which muſt open my Tomb: But in fine, all thoſe things ſhall be more ſupportable to you, (if you be Generous as I believe you are) then to ſee me chained: They who ſay that true Generoſitie conſiſts in undergoing fatall accidents with conſtancie; And that abandoning life for eviting misfortune, is according to their opinion
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:31892:34"/>a yeelding the Victorie to Fortune: Theſe People (I ſay) knows not what is the true Glorie of Princes.</p>
               <p>This thought is good for Philoſophers, but not for Kings, whoſe whole Actions ſhould be Heroick Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of Valour. But if quitting of life be allowed (which I doubt not) it muſt aſſuredlie be, to ſhune the infamie of being led in Triumph. It is a great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs to a King, to have his Subjects revolt: But if he ſhould then think of dying I would eſteem him baiſe: Becauſe he may fight and puniſh them. It is a great misfortune for a Prince to loſs a Battle: But becauſe it is often ſeen, that they who are conquered to day, may be Victorious to morrow: He muſt ſtand firme, and not abandon himſelf to deſpair. In fine, all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes that can have an honorable remedie, ſhould not make us have recourſe to the Tomb: But when all things are loſt, there remains no more for our choiſe, but enains or death; We muſt break the cords of life to eſcape thoſe of bondage. Behold my dear <hi>Maſſiniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa,</hi> all I had to ſay to you: Remember it then I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure you: And do not Liſten ſo much to what <hi>Scipio</hi> will ſay to you, as not to Remember your promiſe, and the diſcourſe which I have made to you. It is (if I be not deceived) ſo juſt and rationall, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſſaprove of it. Go then, my dear and well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved <hi>Maſſiniſſa,</hi> go fight for my libertie and your Glorie, againſt the inſenſible <hi>Scipio.</hi> Ask him Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablie, if after he was not willing to ſee the fair priſoners he hath made, in his new conqueſts, why he ſhould deſire to ſee a Woman tied to his Chariot, whoſe looks had power to conquer <hi>Maſſiniſſa?</hi> Let him fear that I become not his conquerour, in ſtead of his deſiring to be mine: And that at leaſt the auſtere Vertue which he profeſſes, ſhould ſerve to hinder his deſires of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing over me.</p>
               <p>You may well perceive, my dear <hi>Maſſiniſſa,</hi> that my mind is not troubled, and that I ſpeak to you with abundance of tranquillitie: And I do alſo aſſure you, that in the condition I find my ſelf, there is nothing I regrate, but my being conſtrained to be ſo ſoon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from you. Doubtleſs this is the onlie thing can touch my heart: For having ſeen my Countrie
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:31892:35"/>deſolated; <hi>Siphax</hi> priſoner; The Crown fallen from off my head; And what is yet worſe, <hi>Sophonisba</hi> readie to be <hi>Scipios</hi> Captive: After (I ſay) all thoſe things; My Tomb ſhall be a refuge, and reſting place to me, if I could enter there without abandoning you. But I have this comfort in my miſerie, that having ever had an Irreconcilable hatred to the <hi>Romans</hi> Tirranie: I have at leaſt this advantage to have been the captive of a <hi>Numidean</hi> and not of a <hi>Roman:</hi> But alſo of a <hi>Numidean</hi> who is my Husband and Liberator: And whoſe ſlave I no ſooner was, but I was abſolute Miſtris of his Soul. Go then my dear <hi>Maſſiniſſa,</hi> and faill not to keep your promiſe to the unhappie <hi>Sophonisba:</hi> Who will with much impatience expect Libertie, or Poiſon.</p>

The one could not indure the <hi>Idea</hi> of a Chariot, becauſe ſhe believed it Ignominious to its Followers: The other followed the Chariot without trouble, becauſe ſhe thought nothing ſhamefull but crime. The one beheld a Conquerors Triumph with diſpair, as a mightie diſgrace: The other conſidered it with diſdain, as a chance of Fortune. The one died, the other lived: The one ſearched Glorie, where the other believed it Infamie: However as I have ſaid, the one and the other had a Vertuous Subject: So true is it that all things have diverſe Faces, according to the byaſs they are regarded.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now a long time, dear &amp; unfortunat Princeſſes, that I have ſeen your tears trickle in vain: My Conſtancie hath to no purpoſe taught you, that Heroick Spirits can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur great ſorrows without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire: The <hi>Idea</hi> of the Throne which you have loſt, and of the chariot which you have followed, being alwaies freſh in your memorie, makes my example Fruitleſs: And all the days of your life, renew your affliction. You ſtill carrie in your hearts the Irons which you had on your hands, that curſed day wherein you entred <hi>Rome:</hi> And without loſing anie of that Noble pride, which Illuſtrious Birth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires in them who are born with that advantage; <hi>Aurellian</hi> Triumphs yet over you, everie time you call to minde his Triumph. I am verie ſorrie, O my Daughters, that having made you partakers of my diſgraces, I cannot give you conſtancie neceſſar to ſupport them. Yet its the onlie heritage I can leave you a dying, and I do moſt affectionatlie wiſh that that Vertue may paſs from my heart into yours: To the end that being unable to live as Queens, you may at leaſt reign over your ſelves, If through exceſs of misfortune, anie could with Reaſon deſpaire, it is certain <hi>Zenobia</hi> may do it: For as ſhe has had more
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:31892:37"/>Glorie then anie of her ſex could ever obtain; So her mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes have been more deplorable, then any was ever heard of You know that on my ſide you may reckon the <hi>Ptolomees</hi> Kings of <hi>Aegypt</hi> for your fore <hi>Fathers,</hi> and that I am come of the Illuſtrious Blood of <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> But alace! It may be ſaid that the Triumphant Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot which <hi>Auguſtus</hi> appointed for her, is come to me by right of ſucceſſion: And that I have onlie followed what was prepared for her. Yet Fortune hath treated me with greater inhumanitie: For you are not ignorant that I followed a chariot, which I thought I led, and which I had cauſed do with deſign to make Triumph of him, who Triumphed over me. You alſo know, that the beginning of my life, was full of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; The Valiant <hi>Odenat</hi> your Father, and my dear Lord; After he had given me the Crown of <hi>Palmiranea</hi> would alſo make me partaker of his Glorious conqueſts. And I can ſay without vanitie, and without wronging that <hi>Heros</hi> that if he gave to <hi>Zenobia</hi> the Crown which ſhe carried; She did alſo with her own hand add leaves of Laurell to that which Victorie had put upon his head. Yes my Daughters, I can ſay without offending the memorie of <hi>Odenat,</hi> that we together conquered all the Eaſt: And being encouraged by juſt reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we did undertake to revenge upon the <hi>Perſians</hi> the indignities they made the Emperour <hi>Valerian</hi> ſuffer whom <hi>Sapor</hi> keeped priſoner; When in the interim the infamous <hi>Galienus</hi> his Son abandoned himſelf to all ſorts of delight.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>Odenat</hi> did not forebear to ſend him all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners we made in that War: We took the beſt places in <hi>Meſopotamia; Carres,</hi> and <hi>Niſibea</hi> rendered to my dear Lord: And purſueing the Victorie, we routed at <hi>Cteſiphont,</hi> an innumerable multitude of <hi>Perſians;</hi> We made manie <hi>Satrapps</hi> priſoners; their King alſo fled away: And continuing almoſt whollie Victorious, in all our Encounters; Renown made ſuch Proclamations of <hi>Odenates</hi> Valour, that <hi>Galienus</hi> in fine rouſed himſelf. Then ſtimulated by fear rather then gratitude, he made him <hi>Colleague</hi> in the Empire: And to give him alſo more honour, you know he cauſed <hi>Medalles</hi> be made, wherein my dear <hi>Odenat</hi> dragged the <hi>Perſians</hi> captives, ever till then I had felicitie: Victorie and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:31892:37"/>Fortune equallie favoured me: But alace! And muſt I ſay it? When my dear <hi>Odenat</hi> was aſſaſined with the eldeſt of my Children; I paſt from one extreamitie to an other: And became as miſerable as I had been happie. Then was it my Daughters, that I had need of all my Vertue, to endure that misfortune: And certainlie <hi>Odenates</hi> death, is that, which hath made the loſs of my freedom the leſs rude. I had more trouble to follow my dear Lord to the Tomb, then I had to follow <hi>Aurelians</hi> chariot: And his lamentable Pompe, made me ſhed mere tears, then did all the Magnificence of the Triumph was made of me. But though my grief was exceſſive, I ſpent not too long time in weeping: I thought of preſerving the Empire for my Children, and of waſhing of the Blood which he ſhed, with that of his enemies. And as it might have been ſaid, that Valor was the Soul of that <hi>Heros;</hi> I made vows to paſs my Life time, in gathering Palms to put upon his Tomb: That it might be one day ſaid, my hand alone had revenged his death; Preſerved the Empire for his Children; And Elevated a Trophie to his Glorie. I believed (I ſay) that it was more worthie, to hang above his Coffine, the ſpoils of theſe enemies I ſhould conquer, then to drown his Aſhes with my tears: And being this reſolved I took armes in one hand, and the reins of the Empire in the other. I was alwaies of the opinion, my Daughters, that all Vertues could not be incompatible: That it was not impoſſible for one Perſon to poſſeſs them all: That thoſe of men might be Practiſed by Women: That true Vertue affects no Sex: That one may be both chaſte and Valiant: teſtifie great courage at one time, and humilitie at an other: Be ſevere and meek at ſeverall Occaſions: Command and obey: Know how to carrie Irons and a Crown with the ſame countenance: It is by this conſideration; (my Daughters) that I have done things ſo appearentlie different; though I have ever been what I am to day. But to recount all my life to you, you know that death, which robbed me of my dear <hi>Odenat,</hi> did not take the happineſs of his armes from me. On the contrate, I though his valtor joyned it ſelf with mine: I ſlighted the Armie which <hi>Galienus,</hi> ſent againſt me, under the conduct of <hi>Heraclean:</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:31892:38"/>And unſatisfied with this firſt Victorie, I went into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and made me abſolute Miſtris of my Predeceſſours Kingdom. From thence I was at <hi>Ancyre,</hi> the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Galatia:</hi> I carried like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies my armes through all <hi>Berhinea,</hi> to <hi>Calcedonea,</hi> and below <hi>Boſphore,</hi> and after I had conquered the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> diverſe times, and ſpread the noiſe of my Victories over all the Univerſe; <hi>Aurelian,</hi> guided by Fortune, and being more capable of uſeing a Sword, then <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienus</hi> was; Came at laſt in Perſon to ſtop the courſe. I ſhould Exactlie re-count all my misfortunes to you, as I have done my felicitie, if I did not know, that you remember them but too much: Nor ſhould I have undertaken to Repeat my Victories, if your extream Melancholie made me not think, that your thoughts entertaining nothing but ſorrow full imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, you had forgot them. Surelie you are not ignorant which way <hi>Aurelian</hi> conducted me to <hi>Rome:</hi> Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you remember, how <hi>Herclamones</hi> Perfidie, made him take the Cittie of <hi>Theanea:</hi> How <hi>Mauger</hi> my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and courage, <hi>Aurelian</hi> by his craft gained the Battle of <hi>Antioche:</hi> How <hi>Zabas</hi> Induſtrie put my Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in ſaiftie: How I retreated to <hi>Emeſa:</hi> How I rallied my Troups: How I gave Battle to <hi>Aurelian</hi> a ſecond time; who after thinking he had loſt, was in fine Victor in ſpight of all my endeavours. You know alſo I abandoned <hi>Emeſa,</hi> and went to ſhut my ſelf up in <hi>Palmiranea,</hi> wating for the ſuccourſs which the <hi>Perſians,</hi> the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> and the <hi>Armenians</hi> promiſed me: You know (I ſay) that <hi>Aurelian</hi> came there and beſiedged me, with a ſtrong Armie which was compoſed of <hi>Pannoneans, Dalmatians, Meſineſs, Celtes,</hi> a quantitie of <hi>Mores,</hi> and a multitude of other Troupes, drawn out of <hi>Aſia, Theanea, Meſopotamea, Sirea, Phenitia-</hi> and <hi>Paleſtina.</hi> You know (I ſay) that I ſaw at that time, as great Preparation of War againſt me: As there needed be, to conquer the whole Earth. However I loſt not my heart at that time: You know that I defended the Walls of <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meranea,</hi> with ſo much courage as conduct; That <hi>Aurelian</hi> himſelf was dangerouſlie wounded there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by an Arrow, which may be was drawn at him by my hand: For the gods knows, if I ſpared my life, to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:31892:38"/>preſerve your Libertie: And further, I know ſince my having been at <hi>Rome,</hi> that Poſteritie will know. I did not forſake the Throne, which belonged to you, without defending it. <hi>Aurelian</hi> having writ to his Freind <hi>Macapor,</hi> Said, <hi>It was true, that he fought againſt a Woman: But a Woman who had more Archers under her pay, then if ſhe had been a man, againſt a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who hath Prudence in danger, and who by her fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, hath made ſo great Preparations of War, to Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his conqueſt, that it was impoſſible to imagine, what prodigious number, of Darts, and Stones ſhe had provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In fine (ſaid he ſpeaking of me) there is no place about the Walls of</hi> Palmiranea, <hi>that is not defended by many Machinations: Its Veines Lenches everie hour Arteficiall ſire upon us, and in few words, ſhe fears like a Woman, and fights like a Perſon affeared.</hi> Behold my Daughters, what my Enemie hath ſaid of me: And ſurelie he had not Reaſon to ſay, that I feared, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when he ſent to offer me life and pardon, (for his letter was writ in theſe tearmes) if I would render him the place, and if I would deliver into his hands all my Jewels and Treaſures: I anſwered him ſo reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutelie, that <hi>Aurelian</hi> was offended. I remember among other things that I ſaid, I told him, that never anie but he ſought of me what he deſired: <hi>Remember you</hi> (ſaid I to him) <hi>that Vertue ſhould as well govern affaires of War. as thoſe of peace; And further, I let you know, that the</hi> Perſians <hi>aſſiſtance, which we expect, will not faill us: We have on our partie, the</hi> Armenians, <hi>and</hi> Saraſines: <hi>And</hi> Aurelian, <hi>ſince the robbers of</hi> Sirea <hi>did beat your armie; What ſhall we do when we have all the forces, which we wait for from theſe places? Surely you will then abate ſome of that great pride, with which as if you were whollie victorious, you command me to render.</hi> You ſee, my Daughters, that while you was in the Temple pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Gods, I did all things poſſiblie for your Preſervation, and never did anie unglorious action. Finalie you know, that <hi>Aurelian</hi> did defate the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who were coming to our relief: And ſeeing it abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie impoſſible to ſave that place, I was at leaſt deſirous to ſecure my Perſon: But Fate which had reſolved my Ruine, made <hi>Aurelian</hi> at laſt my Conqueror, and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:31892:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>me his priſoner. How ſoon he ſaw me, he asked' <hi>from whence came it, that I had the boldneſs to attack the</hi> Roman <hi>Emperours and deſpiſe their forces:</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian (ſaid I to him) <hi>I acknowledge you for a lawfull Emperour, becauſe you know how to Conquer; But for</hi> Galienus <hi>and ſuch as he, I never had that eſteem of them.</hi> Till now, my Daughters, you cannot accuſe me of cowardiſe: I have formerlie carried a Crown with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vanitie; I have had my hand ſufficientlie firme, to hold at once a Scepter and a Sword: I have equallie known the Arts of fighting and of reigning: I have known how to Conquer, and which is more, I knew how to uſe the Victorie: I have received good Fortune with Moderation: And in the verie time, wherein Youth &amp; the weakneſs of my Sex, might have made me proud of that little beautie I had: I have without plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure heard, all the flatterers of the Court, paint me in their verſes, with Lilies and Roſes; ſay that my Teeth were Orientall Pearles: That my Eyes, black as they were, ſhined clearer then the Sun; And in fine that <hi>Venus</hi> her ſelf was not ſo beautifull as I My Daughters I have told you all theſe things and I have extended my ſelf more then I ought: To make you comprehend that in all the actions of my life, I was never guiltie of Imbecillitie: Think not then, that in the moſt important of all the actions I have done, or wherein there was greateſt need of courage, that my heart ever fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me, more then at other times. No, my Daughters, I have done nothing in all my life, that gives me more Satisfaction of my ſelf, then that I had power to follow a Triumphing Chariot with conſtancie. It is truelie, at ſuch times, that a great Spirit it requiſite, let it not be ſaid to me, in ſuch encounters that deſpair is a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and conſtancie a weakneſs. No, Vice can never be Vertue, nor can Vertue ever be Vicious. Let none ſay to me, that ſuch conſtancie is more proper for Philoſophers then Kings: But know, my Daughters, that there is no difference betwixt Philoſophers and Kings: If not that the one teaches Veritable Wiſdom, and the other ſhould practiſe it. In fine as Soveraigns owe their example to their Subjects, and becauſe they are in the ſight of all the World; There is no Vertue, which they ought not to imitate. Yet among all theſe
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:31892:39"/>that are moſt neceſſare for Princes, Conſtancie is the more Illuſtrious, as being the moſt difficile: But for that deſpair, which puts the dagger in the hand of them who would evit Bondage, it is rather infirmitie then Vertue. They cannot look upon Fortune when it is Irritated: It would no ſooner attack them, but they ſhun fighting it: It would no ſooner deſtroy them, but they promot its deſigns: By a weakneſs unworthie of them, they yeeld the Victorie to this <hi>airy</hi> thing: And by a Precipitous action, without knowing often what they do, they quit the Irons, in abandoning their lives, whoſe ſweetneſs they only loved, without being able to endure the bitter. For me, my Daughters, who am of an other opinion; I mantain that they who live with Glorie, ſhould die as ſlowlie as poſſible: And that to ſpeak rationallie, a ſudden death is rather a ſign of Remorſe of Repentance, and Imbecillitie, then of great courage. It may be, ſome will ſay to me, that I am of a Race which ſhould never carrie Irons: That ſince <hi>Cleopatra</hi> would not follow <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Chariot, I ſhould never have followed that of <hi>Aurelian:</hi> But there is ſuch a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that great Queen and me, that all her Glorie conſiſted in her death: And I made mine conſiſt in my life. Her reputation had not been advantagious to her, if ſhe had not died by her own hand; And mine ſhould never have been at the height it is come to, if I had deprived my ſelf of the Glorie, of knowing to carrie Irons, with ſuch Grandure of Courage, as if I had Triumphed over <hi>Aurelian,</hi> as he did of me: If <hi>Cleopatra</hi> had followed <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his Chariot, ſhe would have ſeen a hundered odious objects in her traverſing <hi>Rome,</hi> which would have reproached her of her former Imprudences: The People would have certainlie cauſed her underſtand by their murmurings a part of her wanting conduct: But for me, I was verie certain, that I could ſee nothing about the Chariot which I followed, but men whom I had formerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered and witneſſes of my Valor and Vertue. I was, I ſay, aſſured to hear no Contumelie, and to Underſtand no Speeches but of my preſent misfortune, and of my former Victories. Behold, ſaid the People, the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant <hi>Zenobia:</hi> Behold the Woman who did gain ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:31892:40"/>Victories: Admire her conſtancy in this encounter: Might it not be ſaid, that theſe chains of Diamonds, which ſhe carries, do rather ſeen to adorn then bind her; And that ſhe leads the Chariot which ſhe follows? In fine, my Daughters, in the time I was all loaded with Irons, or to name them better, Chains of Gold and Jewels, like a Noble Slave; In the time of all that Magnificent Triumph, which is undoubtedlie the moſt unpleaſant day of Bondage; I was at freedom in my heart, and had my minde quiet enough, to ſee with pleaſure, that my conſtancie, drew tears from ſome of my enemies, Yes, my Daughters, Vertue hath ſo ſtrong charmes, that their <hi>Roman</hi> auſteritie could not reſiſt them; And I ſaw ſome among them weep for <hi>Aurelians</hi> Victorie and my misfortune: Moreover, none ſhould be ſo cowardlie, as to let the minde be troubled, with things that do not at all touch it, if they be perfectlie wiſe. All the great preparations that are made for theſe Triumphs ſhould not fright a rationall Soul: All theſe guilded Chariots, theſe chaines of Diamonds, theſe Trophies of Armes, and the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of People who flock together, to ſee that fatall Ceremonie, ſhould not make a Generous Perſon time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ous, It is true, my chains were weightie; But when they hurt not the minde, they do not much incomode the armes that carrie them: And for me in that deplorable ſtate, I manie times thought that as fortune had made me follow a Chariot, I my ſelf had done it for Triumph; By that ſame Revolution which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls all things in the World: You may perhaps one day have Scepters made to you, of theſe ſame chains which I carried. But in fine, if this ſhould not come to paſs, afflict your ſelves moderatlie: Be more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to approve your ſelves worthie of the Throne; Then to remount it: For in the humor I am of, I have more eſteem of a ſimple ſlave, if he be faithfull, then of the moſt potent King in the World, if he be not Generous. Think then my Daughters, of indur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Bondage with more conſtancie: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve certainlie, that if I have been conquered by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relian:</hi> Mine ſurpaſſed fortune, it may be ſeen through all the courſe of my life, that death did not fright me, if I could have had Glorie by it: I have ſeen it a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:31892:40"/>times under a more terrifying countenance then the moſt deſperate have ever ſeen: <hi>Cato</hi> his dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, <hi>Brutus</hi> his ſword, <hi>Porcias</hi> burning coals, <hi>Mithra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi> his poiſon, nor <hi>Cleopatras</hi> aſpes, are anie way ſo fearfull. I have ſeen greeles of darts and arrowes fall upon my head; I have ſeen the points of a hundered lances preſented to my heart; And all this without anie thoughts of fear. Think not then, if I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved death could have been Glorious to me, but that I could have found it by my own hand. It was accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to conquer others; And it would have broken my Irons if I would: But I thought my ſhaire of Glorie would be greater, to carrie them without weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then to ſpill my Blood through feebleneſs or deſpair. They whoſe ſatisfaction onlie conſiſts in themſelves, quits the Throne with leſs regrate then others: They who encounter nothing but content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their minds, are conſtrained to ſeek their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, in things that they are ſtrangers to. It may be then you will ask me, what remains for Princeſſes to do, who have loſt their Empire and Libertie? I ſhall anſwer you reaſonablie, that ſince the Gods were deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to give your courage ſo Noble a Subject, you are oblieged to uſe it well: And to make all the World know, by your Patience and Vertue, that you merit the Scepter which is taken from you; And that the Irons which were given you, were unworthie of you, This, my Daughters, is what remains for you to do: And if you could let your ſelves be moved by my example and reaſons; You ſhould find that your life might yet be pleaſing and Glorious to you. At leaſt you have this advantage, that in the condition your Fortune is, it cannot become worſe then it is: So that if you can but once accuſtome your ſelves to it, nothing can after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards trouble your repoſe. Remember that of the manie millions of men whom the World contains, there are not an hundreth who carrie Crowns: And do you believe, my Daughters, that all theſe men are unhappie, and that there is no pleaſure but on the Throne? If it be ſo, O how you are deceived! There is no condition of life, but hath pain and pleaſure: And it is true Wiſdom, to know how to uſe all equallie, if Fortune bring you to the triall of it. They who kill
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:31892:41"/>themſelves, know not that while People are living, they are in a ſtate of acquiring Glorie: There is no Tyrran can hinder me from Immortaliſing my name everie day, if he let me live, and if I be Vertuous: And if my verie ſilence, do make me ſuffer anie pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, while I endure it with conſtancie, it ſhall not forebear to ſpeak of me. Let us live then, my Daughters, becauſe we can do it with honour: And becauſe we alſo have the means left us of teſtifying our Vertue, the Scepter, the Throne, the Empire which we have loſt, were they not given us by Fortune: But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy comes directlie from the gods. It was from their hands I received it: And for that cauſe you ought to imitate it: It is the true ſign of <hi>Heroes,</hi> as deſpare is of the weak or inconſiderat. Trouble not your ſelves then, for what poſteritie will ſay of me? And do not fear that the day of <hi>Aurelians</hi> Triumph, hath obſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Victories; Since as I ſaid to you, it was the moſt Glorious of my life. And moreover I know that <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> hath made a picture of me at his ſpeaking to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate which ſhall make me known to Poſteritie: Preſerve it then, my Daughters, that when I ſhall be no more, the remembrance of what I have been, may oblidge you to be alwaies what you ought. Behold the culores wherewith <hi>Aurelian</hi> hath painted his tablet: <hi>I have learned</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that I be not reproached of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an action ſo little worthy of great courage, by Triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over</hi> Zenobia: <hi>But they who blame me, knows not what Praiſe I Merit, if they knew what a Woman ſhe was: How well adviſed Counſells ſhe had: How cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious ſhe ſhowed her ſelf, and conſtant in keeping good Order: How Imperious and Grave ſhe was among Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: How Liberall when her affaire oblidged her: And how ſevere and exact, when neceſſity conſtrained her: I could ſay it was by her aſſiſtance, that</hi> Odenat <hi>conquered the</hi> Perſians, <hi>and purſued the King</hi> Sapor <hi>to</hi> Cteſiphont: <hi>I could affirme that this Woman had ſo poſſeſt all the</hi> Eaſt <hi>and</hi> Aegypt <hi>with the terrour of her armes: That neither the</hi> Arabians, Saraſians <hi>nor</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menianes <hi>dared to move.

No <hi>Volumnius,</hi> in the ſtate I am Reduced to, I neither can nor ought to live: You know that contrare to my Sex, that Philoſophie which you employ againſt me, is not altogether unknown to me; And that the Vertuous <hi>Cato</hi> my Father, madh me learn it with greatcare. Think not then that the Reſolution I take, is the Effect of a Spirit blinded with its own grief, and of deſpair without Reaſon. I have meditated upon it a long time: And in the Viciſſitudes of things, I have formed a deſign, which I ſhall execute to day. Any other but I might ſatisfie their Husbands Aſhes, with ſhedding of tears all the reſt of their dayes, but the Daughter of <hi>Cato,</hi> and Wife of <hi>Brutus</hi> ſhould do it an other way. Alſo I am verie well aſſured, that <hi>Porcia</hi> has too great a Soul, to lead a Life Unworthie of her Birth; And of the honor of having had for her Father
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:31892:44"/>and Husband, the two moſt Illuſtrious of the Ancient <hi>Romans:</hi> But for them who live to day, they are the Remains of <hi>Julius Ceſars</hi> ſlaves; or to ſay better, they are enraged Tygers, who tear their Mothers bowells, by deſolating their Countrie. Wo is me! Who could ever have thought, that the <hi>Roman</hi> People, were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come enemies of their own Libertie? That it could be they themſelves, who not onlie forged the chains which did captivate them; Who not onlie ſet upon the Throne him who was the cauſe of ſo manie mens deaths, that he might come to it; But who was alſo capable of weeping for the death of a Tyrran; Place him in the rank of the gods; And criminallie purſue, a man, who to give them libertie, hazarded his life &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed <hi>Ceſars</hi> Friendſhip? For what would not he had obtained from him, if he could have ſubmitted to Bondage? His Irons ſhould have been certainlie-ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then others: And for a little pains which he might have taken, he might have been Maſter of him who was of all the World. But <hi>Brutus</hi> was too Generous, to eſtabliſh his particular felicitie, upon the Ruine of the <hi>Reipublick:</hi> He knew that the firſt duty took, or ought to take away all other: That owing all things to his Country, he owed nothing to <hi>Ceſar:</hi> That being born a <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen, he ought to hate Tyrranie: That not to be ungrate to his Country, he muſt be partlie againſt <hi>Ceſar:</hi> And that being of the firſt <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> his Race, he owed the aſſiſtance of his Arms and Valor, to the oppreſſed <hi>Reipublick.</hi> Nevertheleſs after he had done all theſe things, theſe cowardlie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible People, exiled him, for whom they ſhould have erected atues in all their publick places. Yet this great ungratitude wearied not the vertue of <hi>Brutus:</hi> you know, O wiſe <hi>Volumnius!</hi> All that he has done for his Countrey: Nor do I tell it to make you learn; But to employ that little life that remains in me, to ſpeak of his Heroick Actions, and to conjure you, to make them known to Poſteritie. Remember then, <hi>Volumnius,</hi> that though all the <hi>Romans</hi> were ungrate to him, he deſiſted not to do all things for them: And when theſe Sluggards, in place of one Tyrran had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered three; He had more compaſſion for them, then reſentment of their ungratitude: And without think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:31892:44"/>of his own Preſervation, what did he not to make them happie? Maugre what they had been? But theſe enemies of Vertue are ſo well accuſtomed to ſlaverie, that they hoard up their chaines as their de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But to day when I have no more to loſs, and when I ſee an infallible way of ending my miſerie; My Soul is more tranquill: And though my grief be greater then anie was ever felt, I endure it with leſs impatience; Becauſe I know it ſhall be quicklie finiſhed. Do not then tell me that I ought to live, for preſerving the memorie of <hi>Brutus:</hi> The action he did is ſo Heroick and Noble, that it ſhall ever be remembered by all men.

For I doubt not but <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall be continuallie in ſlaverie: Being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtable, that if its freedom could have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, <hi>Brutus</hi> would have reſtored it: But ſince he could not do it, he had at leaſt the Glorie of dying without being a ſlave. Think it not ſtrange then, that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:31892:45"/>being Daughter and Wife to two men, who were even free to death, I would partake of that Glorie with them. And yet to ſpeak truelie, <hi>Brutus</hi> ſhall not be altogether at libertie, If I were ſo baſe as to live a Captive. There will be ſomewhat wanting to his Glorie, if I forget mine: The affection that he had alwayes to me, makes our intereſts unſeparable.

The images of <hi>Cato,</hi> and of my dear <hi>Brutus,</hi> do ſo fill my ſpirit. that I ſee no other thing: And me thinks their death is ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of envie, that I took upon it as the cheifeſt good can ever befall me. Remember, <hi>Volumnius,</hi> that the true zeall of Vertue conſiſts in the deſires of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating it: For they who praiſe Vertuous People, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out traceing them ſo much as they can, deſerves blame raither then praiſe, becauſe they know the good and do not follow it: <hi>Cato</hi> is dead with this advantage, to have had it ſaid by <hi>Ceſar,</hi> that he envied his death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it deprived him of the Glorie of his Pardon: And I wiſh that <hi>Octavius</hi> may envie <hi>Brutus,</hi> for having choſen a Wife abundantlie couragious to follow him to the Tomb. It is there we ſhall enjoy a libertie which we can nomore loſs; While the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhall groan under the weight of their Irons. But a day will come, when the name of <hi>Brutus</hi> ſhall be in veneration among them: When they ſhall deſire that good which they refuſed: And when the blood of <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Brutus</hi> ſhall confound and make them bluſh. Yes, theſe <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens, who ſaw themſelves Maſters of the Earth; Who had Kings for their Subjects, whoſe Glorie was without tashe, and whoſe power had no Authoritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it but that of the Gods, ſhall become infamous ſlaves: And their Bondage ſhall be ſo rigid, that they ſhall not be Maſters of their own will. They ſhall take from the Tyrrans all their vices: And <hi>Rome</hi> which was a Seminarie of Vertue, ſhall be a receptacle of vile Adulatores. O Heavens! That the Inclinatons of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:31892:45"/>ſuch mightie People, ſhould be thus altered in an inſtant? All theſe millions of men, who fought on the plains of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> under <hi>Pompeyes</hi> coulors, were they all killed in that battle? Or have they loſt their hearts in loſing it? All theſe Kings who hold their Crowns, of the Senats authoritie, are they all ungrate? And is there none who could ſuffer <hi>Brutus</hi> to unburthen them of their chains? The deſire of freedom, which is ſo ſtrong among all the creatures who live upon the Earth, is it extinguiſhed among men? And is the bloud of a dead Tyrran, ſo dear to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that to honor his memorie, and to wear mourning, they muſt load themſelves with chains all their life? Yes, all the <hi>Roman Legiones</hi> have loſt their hearts; All the Kings own Vaſſals, are readie to lay their Crowns at their Tyrrans feet; All the <hi>Romans</hi> do preferr ſervitude to libertie; <hi>Ceſars</hi> Aſhes are in veneration among them; And for their laſt misfortune <hi>Brutus</hi> hath abandoned them. However, do not think, <hi>Volumnius,</hi> that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to forſake me: It is true when we parted in the Citie of <hi>Elea,</hi> he would not let me go with him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I did all things poſſible for it; Becauſe ſaid he the journey would be verie troubleſome to me: And becauſe I might be of more profit to him at <hi>Rome;</hi> Then in this armie. But at that time it was not ſo: I know <hi>Brutus</hi> minded me a dying: He expects me in the place where he is; And he doubts not, but <hi>Porcia</hi> remembers, that the Illuſtrious <hi>Cato</hi> loved better to tear his entrails, then to ſurrvive his contreyes freedom: And that ſhe having more valide reaſons to perſwade her; will not faill to follow the way that he hath pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed for her. When life can be neither honorable, nor happie, it is great wiſdom to abandone it: Being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that it ſhould be no longer dear to us, then when it can ſerve for our Glorie, or that of our Coutrey: Since it is ſo, I ought no more to preſerve mine. Yes, <hi>Volumnius,</hi> I owe my death to my own Glorie; To that of <hi>Cato;</hi> To that of <hi>Brutus:</hi> And to that of <hi>Rome.</hi> But do not think that this death ſhall be rude to me: I go to a place where Vertue is certainlie known, and rewarded.

I know that though ambition be as ſtrong a paſſion as love; It does not ſurmount it in your Soul: And I will alſo believe to comfort me in my diſgrace, that if you were in condition to diſpoſe abſolutlie of your ſelf, you would prefer the poſſeſſion of <hi>Berinicea,</hi> to the Empire of all the World. But this reaſon of ſtate, which Authoriſes ſo manie Crimes, and ſo much Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, cannot endure that after the invincible. <hi>Titus,</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:31892:49"/>hath ſo manie times hazarded his life, to ſecure the <hi>Romans</hi> felicitie, ſhould think of his own particular. Yet I have never heard it ſaid, that love was a ſhamfull paſſion, when its object was honeſt: On the contrare, I thought it a ſign of great Spirits, becauſe all the <hi>Horces</hi> of antiquitie were capable of it. I thought (I ſay) that when this paſſion reignes in a Generous Soul, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires it with new deſires of acquireing Glorie: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, I plainlie ſee that this is not the Emperours, nor the Senates opinion; And that I am deceived in my conjectures. Had you choſen for the object of your love, a perſon abſolutlie unworthie of you, their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints ſhould be more tollerable, and I ſhould merit the treatment I receive, if I had in fuſed any baiſe or ſhamefull thought, in the Soul of <hi>Titus:</hi> but if I be not miſtaken, they cannot reproach you of having made an Alliance too unequall. <hi>Alexander</hi> thought that he did nothing againſt his own Glorie, when he Married <hi>Roxana,</hi> though ſhe was both a Captive and Stranger: And that error which love cauſed him commit, hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not the noiſe of his Victories, from coming to us: Nor his being ranked among the moſt Illuſtrious <hi>Heroes.</hi> The fault which you are reproached off, hath nothing comparable to that: For in fine, you know, I am <hi>Mariamnes</hi> grand-Daughter; I have all the ancient Kings of <hi>Judea,</hi> for my Predeceſſors, and I my ſelf do carrie a Crown, which me thinks ſhould oblidge the Senat, not to treate me ſo cruellie. Yes <hi>Titus, Paleſtina</hi> hath had <hi>Heroes,</hi> as well as <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanes,</hi> the <hi>Davids,</hi> the <hi>Solomons,</hi> from whom I am come, have perhaps done as brave actions, as the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mules,</hi> the <hi>Numa Pompiliuſes</hi> or the <hi>Ceſares:</hi> And the Noble and Rich ſpoils, which you took in the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and wherewith you adorned your Triumph, makes <hi>Rome</hi> too much ſee the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, and magnificence of my Fathers. If I were of a blood that were enemie to the <hi>Reipublick,</hi> as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlie <hi>Sophonisba Haſdruballs</hi> Daughter was, I would ſay that they had reaſon to fear, that after having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered the Generous <hi>Titus,</hi> I would make my Victorie fatall to the Senate: And at laſt, cauſe him do actions contrare to his Authoritie. But I am of a Race accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to receive Crowns from the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours:
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:31892:49"/>The great <hi>Agrippa</hi> my Father, did hold the Kingdom of <hi>Liſania,</hi> of <hi>Cajus</hi> his liberalitie, as well as that of <hi>Chalſis,</hi> whoſe Scepter I carrie this day, The ſecond <hi>Agrippa</hi> my Brother, received the ſame favour from the Emperour your Father: And his death made it ſufficientlie known, that he was not ungrate. It was in your preſence he loſt his life, having a deſire to oblidge the inhabitants of <hi>Gamalia</hi> to render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and acknowledge <hi>Veſpaſians</hi> authoritie: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to comfort me for his death, they baniſh me like a Criminall. They ſay I would overthrow the Empire; And ſcarce can they find a corner of the Earth, fart enough from <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein to ſend me in exile. Yet you know, O my dear Lord, that I have committed no other fault, but the receiving the honor which you have done to me, by giving me the Glorious Tittle of your Wife: the innocent conqueſt that my eves made of your heart, is that which makes me culpable; The <hi>Romans</hi> would have you be their Captive, and not mine: They would (I ſay) diſpoſe of your love, and hatred as they pleaſe; And chooſe a Wife for you according to their fancie, and not according to your inclinations. Moreover, my dear Lord, I know my tears may be ſuſpected, by them who know me not: They of my enemies who will ſee my grief, doubtleſs will ſay, that I regrate the Empire as much as <hi>Titus:</hi> And that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition hath a greater ſhare of my Soul, then Love, But if you truelie love me as much as you have told me, You will judge my thoughts by your own: And You ſhall certainlie know that your perſon onlie cauſes all my ſorrow, as it did all my felicitie. No, <hi>Titus,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Magnificence hath not tranſported me: The Throne which You expect; Contributed nothing to the affection I have for You: And the Vertues of your Soul, and the love which. You teſtified to me, were the onlie things I conſidered, when I did reſolve to love You. Take then when You pleaſe, a Perſon with whom You ſhall divide, the Soveraign Power You ſhall one day have, without thinking I wiſh her anie harme; But for favours ſake, never divide the heart where You made me reign. It is an Empire which belongs to me, and which You cannot take from me without injuſtice, You cannot, my dear <hi>Titus,</hi> accuſe me of asking too
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:31892:50"/>much; Becauſe I demand nothing but what you gave me. No more can you ſay, that this heart is not in your power; That <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> holds it in his hands; That the Senate diſpoſes of it; And in fine, that you are not its Maſter. All ſlaves, though as ſtronglie fettered with chains as they poſſiblie can, enjoy this priviledge: They love and hate what ſeems good to them: And their will is as free in the Irons, as if they were on the Throne. Since it is ſo, you muſt certainlie enjoy the ſame freedom, and ſhall not reſuſe me the favour I ask from you. You may get a Wife for the Illuſtrious <hi>Titus,</hi> to content the Capricoes of the People: But you muſt not give a Rivall to <hi>Berinicea.</hi> She muſt be ſingle in your Soul, as you are in hers: And though ſhe be ſeparated from you, yet ſhe ſhall ever be preſent in your minde: If it be ſo I ſhall patientlie endure my exille. But Gods! can I think never to ſee you again. No, <hi>Titus,</hi> it is abſolutlie impoſſible for me: my fate is inſeparable from yours: and though <hi>Veſpaſiane</hi> and the Senates authoritie doe all they can, I muſt not quit you. It would be imbecillity to abandone you: you might reproachfullie ſay to me, that fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing male-treated, made me too ready to obey the order I received for going out of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in fine, you might accuſe me of little love, But no, I will contradict that thought: It would be ingratitude to uſe it ſo, <hi>Berinicea</hi> muſt not coſt you the Empire: Preſerve it then, and let her depart. It is enough to her that you complain: And that when you are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to the Crown, you then call to mynd that the poſſeſſion which you ſhall have, did coſt you <hi>Beri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicea.</hi> Truelie, <hi>Titus,</hi> there is ſome ſtrange thing in our adventure: For it ſhould be the leaſt thing to think, that theſe ſame people, who alreadie prepare themſelves to acknowledge you for Maſter of all the Earth, would be Law givers to you, in an affaire of ſuch importance to you, and of ſo little to them? And that theſe ſame perſons, over whom you ſhall have an abſolute power, to diſpoſe of their fortunes and lives; May not ſuffer you to love me? Am I Wife or enemie of all the <hi>Romans;</hi> Have they jealouſie, or hatred to me? Fear they that I will prevaill with you to rebuild the walls of <hi>Jernfalem?</hi> Have I inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:31892:50"/>any thing againſt the common good, or have I offended any of them in particular? No <hi>Titus,</hi> I have done nothing, I have ſaid nothing, I have thought nothing againſt them: And my greateſt crime is that I am unhappie, and that you love me. But would to Heaven, that I be in that manner Criminall all my life: Continue, my dear Lord, to give them, new ſubject of hateing me by loving me alwayes: Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie to them, that the Victime which you ſacrifice for them is dear to you: And for your glorie as much as myne, make them know that the affection you have for me, hath lawfull fundationes. Conceall my faults, and carefulie exaggerate the few good qualities are in me: tell them that the affection which I had for you, ſerved in ſtead of merit. And in fine, that you have found in my perſone, she object worthie of your love. For me, I am not troubled to juſtifie what I have for you; your Valor and Vertue are ſo equallie known through all the Earth, that I need not tell for what reaſons I love you, This ſentiment is ſo univerſall, that though you were not infinitly Good, you ſhould not be oblidged to me. But my dear <hi>Titus,</hi> ſhall I tell you ſomething, that is in my minde! Yes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my affection hath cauſed it, you cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed and you are too juſt to condemn <hi>Berenieta,</hi> when you ſhall know that ſhe is onlie guiltie of exceſs of Love. I would not in the condition that things are in to day, robb you of the Crown which you ought to carrie, by oblidging you to follow me: For, my dear Lord, there is no corner of the Earth, where the Illuſtrious <hi>Titus</hi> can live unknown. But if it be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted me to tell you all that I think, I wiſh that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born without Crown, without Kingdom, and without Empire, we could leave together in ſome place where Vertue alone ſhould Reign with us. I wiſh (I ſay) that you were not what you are. And yet I would not have you changed, In fine, the exceſs your grief and affection, makes that finding nothing that ſatiſfies me, among all things poſſible, I am conſtrained for my conſolation, to make wiſhes which are impoſſible to execute, Pardon me, my door <hi>Titus,</hi> If I would rob you of a Crown: I reprehend my ſelf becauſe I know by your eyes you are no off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:31892:51"/>Till now I never thought that I could ſee you greived, and not be a partaker with you: Yet ſurely that which I ſee Painted in your face, ſweetneth my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction: Your tears diminiſhes the bitterneſs of mine: And in the condition my Soul is in, I can have no reflection ſo pleaſing as to ſee you infinitly afflicted. Yes <hi>Titus,</hi> my diſpair is ſo great, that ſince I cannot live happie with you, there are moments wherein I ſhall wiſh that we were alwaies unhappie, ſo that we could but be together. Yet this unjuſt thought does not laſt long in my mind: And paſſing from one extremity to another, I ſhall wiſh that I were yet more unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and that you were not at all. Methinks then the <hi>Romans</hi> have reaſon to exile me, becauſe I am capable of diſturbing the repoſe of their Prince. I wiſh I could depart without afflicting you; Carrie away in my heart, your ſorrow with my own: And by ſo tender a thought, I pittie you more then my ſelf. Moreover, if I can poſſiblie live without you, I am ſure I ſhall hear often newes of you, though you your ſelf ſhould give me none: Fame will tell me of ail your brave actions: And I heartily wiſh that it would load it ſelf with my tears, as well as with your exploits, thereby to let you know that neither time nor abſence, had anie way Diminiſhed my ſorrows or affection. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, my Dear <hi>Titus,</hi> everie time that your heart makes you do a brave action; That there <hi>Berenicea</hi> ſhall find both a ſubject of joy and of grief. She ſhall rejoice at your glorie, and afflict her ſelf for the loſs ſhe has had: But when that doth come to paſs, ſhe ſhall ever love you equallie. Nevertheleſs, I think I ſhall not be long in pain, to partake of what befals you: for my grief which I feel is ſo great, That I believe it cannot be long. If my exile had been cauſed by your inconſtancie, that you had changed your thonghts of of me; That your diſdain had been the cauſe of my diſgrace; I ſhould have comforted my ſelf by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of you; I ſhould mitigate my Torment, by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling you ungrate &amp; perfidious: Choller &amp; deſpight ſhould devide my heart: I might one day hope to love you no more: And whether by reſentment or glorie, I ſhould almoſt depart from you without weeping. But as matters goe, I ſe call over ſubjects to afflict me;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:31892:51"/>And nothing that can ſweeten my grief. I not only loſs a lover, I loſs a Faithfull lover; And I loſs him in ſuch a manner, that it permits me not to complain of him, I accuſe the Senate and the people, that I may not complain of the Emperor, becauſe he is his Father: And without being able to accuſe him, If not of his having loved me too well, I depart the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt woman that ever was! But unſenſible that I am, what do I ſay? By that I find ſome cauſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me: Becauſe I quit <hi>Titus,</hi> and he not me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune plucks me from him againſt his will: It threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens to take the Crown from him, If he conſent not to my baniſhment: And at this time I have the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, of ſeeing my dear <hi>Titus</hi> eſteem me more then the Empire of all the World. However it is true, that I muſt forſake him: Yet I have this little comfort at our parting, to know that I dwell in his heart, and that nothing can chaſe me thence. If I be not miſtaken I ſee by your ſilence that you conſent to what I ſay; Your ſighes does aſſure me, and your teares permit me not to doubt. You have too delicate a Soul to be capable of infidelitie or forgetfulneſs: Unconſtancie is a fault, which cannot be fouud in you, be cauſe it is certainly, a ſign, of imbicilitie or little Judgement. The heart muſt not be given without a long premeditation: But when once given it muſt never be retaken. For me, I find we have more right over others goods, which belong not to us; then we have of the preſents which our liberalitie gives Others things may ſometimes come under our power without injuſtice: But what we once give, ſhould never again be ours. It is a renouncing of all right we have to pretend to it; And no Law can with equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty put us in poſſeſion of it. Since it is ſo, I am aſſured to have alwayes the poſſeſſion of your heart: It is by that thought that I can hope to live in my exile. It is the onlie thing can ſupport my life: And for that only can I, ſay that I am not abſolutely unhappie. I hope the <hi>Romans</hi> will in time know, that as your love to me had nothing of injuſtice, ſol have inſpired you with nothing but rationall thoughts. I deſire not <hi>Titus,</hi> that you loſs your ſelf for preſerving me; I will not have you oppoſe the Emperor; I will not
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:31892:52"/>have you acquire the Senats hatred; I will not have you irritate the People againſt you; I will not have you endeavour to make the Legions Rebel; I will not have you refuſe the fair <hi>Arricidea,</hi> who I know is appointed for you; I will not (I ſay) have you loſe the Empire for love of me. On the contrare I coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and conjure you to obey the Emperor, to follow the Senats advice; to content the humours of the people; to keep your legiones, to make new conqueſts; to receive on the Throne the too happy <hi>Arricidea:</hi> and preſerve the Empire which Fate promiſes, and birth gives you. But when to my prejudice you have ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied all the World, be ſo juſt as to remember, that <hi>Berenicea</hi> ſhould by your only paſſion.

Yes, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> your Generoſitie, his gratitude and mine, have put him in the deplorable condition that he is in. You ſee him all covered with his own bloud, and with that of your enemies. The great manie wounds he hath received over all his bodie, are certaine proof of what he gave to them who fought him. His mightie Courage, changed that of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> into deſpair: And that Illuſtrious hand, which they have almoſt ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from his arm, (alace! what an object to <hi>Panthea!</hi>) makes it ſufficientlie ſeen, that he quitted not his
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:31892:54"/>armes but by quitting his life. He was ſeen, Generous <hi>Cyrus,</hi> fight with ſuch Ardencie, that it was ſaid, that the gaining of that Battle, ought to put the Crown of the World upon his head. He hath retributed the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations I had from you, with his perſon, his blood, and his life: And in this manner, O invincible <hi>Cyrus,</hi> (as I have told you alreadie) your Generoſitie, his Gratitude and mine, have cauſed his death and my miſerie. However I do not accuſe you; I am too juſt to do that: On the contrate, I thank you kindlie, for offering your aſſiſtance to comfor me, I praiſe in you, O <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that Generous ſentiment, which makes your ſhed tears, the verie day of your Victorie: And which makes you greive more for the death of your freind, then rejoice for the gaining of the Battle, and defait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all your enemies. But after I have done your Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue this juſtice, ſuffer me, without either accuſing you, or repenting me, to complain of the rig our of my fate, which owing the preſervation of my honour to you, would oblidge me my ſelf to expoſe my dear <hi>Abdradates</hi> to a fight, where multitudes made him Succumb. It was onlie for the love of me, that he abandoned <hi>Creſus</hi> forces: For though he had juſt enough cauſe not to ſerve him, the memorie of the dead King his Father, who loved him dearlie, made him not abandone the Son, though leſs Vertuous. But I no ſooner made my obligations from you known to him, then he freelie offered to acquitt me with you, for ſo ſenſible an obligation. Your fame had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie diſpoſed his heart, to conſent to what I asked: And having alreadie eſteemed you infinitlie, it was eaſie for him to love you. In fine, <hi>Cyrus,</hi> you know, he teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied at that time, great Gratitude to you, and great love to me. No, ſaid he to me, Generous <hi>Panthea, Abdradates</hi> cannot be your Protectors enemie: He hath dried up your tears, and I muſt ſpend my blood in his ſervice, he hath been carefull of your glorie, and my Valour muſt increaſe his: He hath loſt a man whom he verie much loved, by Protecting you I ought to repaire that loſs; And if it be poſſible, not let it be perceived in the day of Battle, that <hi>Araſpes</hi> is not there. Yes, ſaid he to me a loud, I ſhall loſs my life, or I ſhall teſtifie to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that they who receive
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:31892:54"/>benefits as they ought, are ſome times as generous as they who give them. Wo is me! Muſt I tell it, I never gain-ſaid this diſcourſe: And without apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any fatall Event from ſo Noble an Intention, I praiſed his reſolution and deſigne I thanked him for that, which was to become the cauſe of my ſupream mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune; &amp; contributing to my own unhappineſs, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited his courage to do thins which have cauſed his death to day; And yet which will make him live Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallie.

And having ſo profitably ſhed his blood, for gaining of the Battle, why ſhould he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt have been the onlie one, who enjoyed not the Fruits of the Victorie? But it was not in this encounter alone, that I contributed to my own Diſaſter: So great was my blindneſs, that I expected that fatall day, like a day of Triumph: My ſpirit was filled with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but hope; My imagination preſented me with nothing but what was agreeable; I looked upon the concluſion of the fight. as the Commencement of my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

I had ſo much fear that his brave Actions, ſhould not be ſufficientlie known, that I employed all my Jewels, to make his Coat of Armour the more remarkable. But inſenſible that I am, what do I ſay? Doubtleſs I was in paction with his enemies: I was minded to ſhow them where to ſtrick: I was the cauſe of all the wounds that <hi>Abdradates</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: It was I who peirced his heart: And covered all his bodie with blood and wounds, I guided all his Aſſailants hands: And as if it could not have been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that the Generous did fight him, in emulation of his extraordinarie courage: I would alſo make the Avaritious and Mercenarie have the ſame deſigns. In fine, I armed all <hi>Creſus</hi> armie againſt him: Some on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie by deſiring to conquer a man, who ſeemed to be the God of War; And others by the Richneſs of the Bootie. It was my hand put on <hi>Abdradates</hi> his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:31892:55"/>that curſed day: yes Generous <hi>Cyrus,</hi> I my ſelf brought the cauſe of my ruine to him: and though in that very inſtant, a ſecret horrour ſeiſed me, which foretold my miſerie. I deſpiſed a revelation, which was ſent me by the Gods, and though I could not reſtain my teares, I was ſo unjuſt as to conceal them from my dear, <hi>Abdradates.</hi> Me thought it would be a robbing him of his heart, to teſtifie to him that I wanted one at ſuch a time: But imprudent that I was? I ought to have ſhowed him my Tears with all their bitterneſs: For I doubt not, If by my grief I had let him know, that my life depended upon the preſervation of his; But he would have taken a little more care of himſelf then he did. He would have equallie conſidered your glorie and my life: But O Illuſtrious <hi>Cyrus,</hi> it ſeems at that time that I neither cared for that of <hi>Abdradates</hi> nor my own: For when I had made an end of arming him, and had led him to the Magnificent Chariot that waited for him; I did neither ſpeak to him of himſelf nor of me; But Wholie of your obligations to me, I remembered him that when you might have uſed me as a ſlave, you treated me like a Queen that having had the miſfortun of diſpleaſing a man whom you loved better then your ſelf, you was ſo generous, as to defend one from him; and that after ſo heroick an action: I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to you that he would be as faithfull and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to you, as <hi>Araſpes</hi> had been, Behold. Gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Cyrus,</hi> what I ſaid to my Dear <hi>Abradates,</hi> being readie to depart from me for the laſt time.

And having ſo ſaid he left me; And looking upon me ſo long as it was poſſible when he was in the Charriot, he commanded his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilion to drive.

They who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire not to acknowledge a benefit, can have no greater puniſhment then to be forced to publiſh it: Wherefore I will not conſtrain you, to avouch from your own mouth, that neither by right of Birth, nor of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, nor by that of our Lawes, could you while I am alive have anie pretenſions to the Kingdom of the <hi>Gothes:</hi> Becauſe I was in poſſeſſion of it, as Daughter, Wife, and Mother of them whoſe in was; And who left it to me after them, as their lawfull Heireſs. Nor are you ignorant that you are born my Subject: And that you would have ſtill been ſo; If by a verie extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinare goodneſs, I had not deſcended from the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:31892:59"/>Throne to conduct you to it. However after I had taken the Crown from off my own head to give it you; After I had depoſited my Scepter in your hands, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to make a King of your Perſon: After all that it was, ſeen that I had much ado, to make the <hi>Gothes</hi> obey you; It was ſeen (I ſay) that the firſt things you did, was to recall to the Court, all them whom I had baniſhed for their crimes: And after you had choſen my greateſt enemies for your principall Miniſters. <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates.</hi> That ſame <hi>Theodates,</hi> whom <hi>Amalaſontha</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Theodorick</hi> the great, had made a King: Whom ſhe by her own hand had Crowned; And to whom as a manefeſt proof of her power, ſhe demitted the Regall authoritie, unjuſtlie exilles her, who gave him the power of baniſhing her. O Heavens! Is it poſſible to ſee the like ungratitude among men? And is it alſo poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that <hi>Amalaſontha</hi> hath made ſo bad a choiſe? No <hi>Theodates</hi> I am not like you: I will not condemn you without hearing: You muſt certainlie have ſome reaſon for hateing and baniſhing of me. What did I againſt you while you was my Subject? Or what have I done againſt you, ſince I have made you a King? I remember verie well in the time you was under my morigiration; And when I had the power of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or rewarding you; I verie well remember, that multitudes of <hi>Tuſcanes,</hi> having come to complain to me, of the violences your avarice made you commit againſt them, I remember (I ſay) that being angrie no ſee you guiltie of a paſſion, unbefiting <hi>Theodoricks</hi> Nephew; I uſed all my endeavours to make you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, that ſuch deſires, were baſe and unjuſt. It is true I oblidged you to reſtore things, which did not belong to you: But it is alſo true that I did nothing but what reaſon and equitie would have me do, I know I told you at that time, that avarice was the infallible ſign of a mean Spirit: That almoſt all covetous People were cowards: That they who ſo pationatlie deſire to heap up Treaſures, take but little care to acquire Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: And in fine, that Avarice for the moſt part was alwaies the companion of ungratitude. See <hi>Theodates,</hi> what I have done againſt you: I have endeavoured to correct a wicked inclination, with which you was born: But do you know <hi>Theodates,</hi> what was then my intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:31892:59"/>I thought of putting a Crown upon your head: I thought of giving my Subjects no cauſe to reproach you, when you ſhould become their King: I thought to hinder them from fearing, that you would be their Tyrran, rather then Soveraign: And that they ſhould not apprehend, that he who had alreadie uſurped their Fortunes, when he was but a Subject like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, would not intirelie Ruine them, when he ſhould be their Maſter. Behold <hi>Theodates,</hi> the true cauſe of the ſharpneſs of that Reprimand, which hath infuſed that hatred in your Soul againſt me. Nevertheleſs, I wonder, that having ſpent the moſt part of your life, in ſtudying <hi>Platos</hi> Philoſophie you ſhould take it ill, to be corrected by anie bodie. They who ſo carefullie learn Wiſdom, ſhould me thinks practiſe it: And I cannot think it ſtrange enough, that you ſhould ſo well remember, the reprehenſion I gave you, and not remember more what I have done for you. When I reſolved your Coronation, I did it not raſhlie, I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered what you was; I endeavoured to foreſee, what you would one day be. I found two inclinations in you which did not pleaſe me: The firſt was that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence, which you alwaies have had of warlike affairs: And the ſecond, that inſatiable deſire, of acquiring everie day new Riches. Yet I thought that the one would oblidge you to be wiſe. And for the other, I thought that a man who believed his avarice could be ſatisfied, with uſurping three or four foot of ground from his Neighbours; Would be cured of that infam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous paſſion when I gave him a Kingdom. I believed (I ſay) that when that avarice wanted an object it would at leaſt become a Noble ambition; That you would thereafter take as much care to merit the Fortune I had given you, as you have alwaies had to purchaſe new. Treaſures; And I believed in fine, that of a covetous and ſloathfull Subject, I ſhould make a prudent and underſtanding King. But I ſhould have alſo thought, that he who could not endure Neighbours at his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey houſe; And who was ſo unjuſt, to augment his Limits by paces; I ſay, I might have verie well thought, that a man of that humor, would never reſolve to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage a Throne with me. Trulie <hi>Theodates,</hi> I do not at all think, that you have well excogitated what you do,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:31892:60"/>for is it poſſible, after I have given you a great King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; After I have made you Maſter of the <hi>Gothes</hi> and all <hi>Italie?</hi> That you can appoint for the place of my baniſhment, that little Iſland of <hi>Bolſina,</hi> ſcituated in the middle of a lake, where there is hardlie place for a ſmall Caſtle? No, <hi>Theodatts,</hi> let us not diſguiſe the truth: The place of my baniſhment, ſhould be rather called my priſon, or rather perhaps my Tomb. May be I ſhall there find my Executioners, thinking to find my guards: And it may alſo be, that in this verie time I am ſpeaking to you, You are vexed at the length of my diſcourſe, becauſe by it the fatall moment of my death is poſtponed. However, you are not yet in condition to accompliſh the crime which you are readie to commit: Conſider <hi>Theodates,</hi> what you are undertaking, Perhaps my death may coſt you your life. Eterniſe then your name ſome other way then by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude: do not begin your reign with an unjuſt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And if it be poſſible, let your repenting for a wicked deſign, make you undertake better. Conſider if I had not been willing to have you reign, I ſhould not have made you a King: And that it be not thought, that I did ſet you upon the Throne, but to preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate you from it. Wherefore, what do you appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend of me? Or to ſay better, what ſhould you not fear, if you exill me? Do you think that the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> will endure without murmuring, the Daughter of <hi>Theodorick,</hi> to be unworthilie treated, by a man whom they do hate ſo much alreadie, when he was but her Subject? That ſecret hatred which they have to you, will appear how ſoon they can find a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text for it: They will equalie think of revenging the abuſe done to me, and alſo themſelves: And in that manner, without <hi>Amalaſonthas</hi> contributing to your Ruine, ſhe ſhall not forbear to overthrow the Throne whereon ſhe hath placed you. The injurie you do to me, doth not reach me onlie, all the Princes of the Earth ought to be concerned with it: And if I be not deceived, you have Neighbours, who under the Title of Protectors of innocence, or revengers of my death, ſhall make incurſions into ſome parts of your Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. If Fortune had otherwaies treated me, That I had loſt the Throne in ſome other manner, Had my
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:31892:60"/>Subjects revolted; Had the Emperour <hi>Juſtinian</hi> made War againſt me; Had <hi>Belliſarius</hi> conquered me; Or had any other conquerors uſurped my Kingdom; I ſhould have been the more eaſilie comforted: But to ſee that by my own hand, the Crown is taken from me, to give it to my perſecutor; Is that which puts a ſtand to my Conſtancie, and all my Vertue. Ha! <hi>Theodates!</hi> Can you ſee <hi>Amalaſontha,</hi> at the foot of the ſame Throne where I have formerlie ſeen you, as my Subject, as a Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, and as a Supplicant? Can you (I ſay) ſee me there, unjſtlie condemned to perpetual baniſhment? Without having done anie other crime in all my life, but that I gave you the Soveraign Power? Perhaps that is the cauſe why Heaven puniſhes me: It would revenge upon me all the injuſtices you wil commit; And make me myſelf experimently feel that, which doubtleſs you will make others undergo. However becauſe my Intentions were moſt ſincere; I cannot repent me of what I have done for you: But ſince I am ſo Generous as not to repent me of a good action; Be you alſo ſo juſt as to repent of a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deſign: And if you will not do it for love to me, let it be done for love to your ſelf. Ungratitude is a Popular vice, which hath never been ſeen upon the Throne but with Monſters: And as liberaltie and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude are the true Vertues of Kings; Avarice and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, are vices which they ſhould never be capable of. They are the diſtributors of benefits, and rewards: That which is avarice in the heart of a Subject, ſhould be Prodigality, in him and that which is ungratitude, ſhould be Ambition in the Soul of a Soveraign. Yes <hi>Theodates,</hi> a King may be ambitious and prodigall, without being diſhonored: But he can never be either covetuous, or ungrate, without being the object of his Subjects diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, and without being execrable to Poſteritie. Doubtleſs your Books have taught you what I ſay, and what onlie experience hath taught me; But you think if I be not miſtaken, that it is eaſier to make a fine diſcourſe then to do a brave action. It is not that the way to Vertue is defficile, if the inclinations be Noble: On the caontrare, it brings its reward along with it; And the pleaſure of doing well, is the more agreeable Value. But that which gives you the trouble of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſelf to it, is that all your inclinations are againſt
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:31892:61"/>you. You cannot be juſt, without fighting againſt yourſelf: you cannot be thankfull, without betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your thoughts: you cannot be liberall without tearing your heart: And to ſay all in one word, you cannot follow vertue without abandoning your ſelf. Yet conſider, <hi>Theodates</hi> that you have but one enemy to ſubdue: Undertake that War if you believe me, and be aſſured it will be glorious to you. You need beſiedge no Cittie; You need give no Battle: You have not Incommodious Voyage to undergo; You need not exhauſt your ſo much beloved Treaſures, to raiſe armes; You need not hazard your life on that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; You need not go into a far countrey to ſeek your enemies; You need not diſturb that profound repoſe, you ſo much delight in; For in fine, without going out of your cloſet, you may find in yourſelf, your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſarie and defender. Your inclinations will oppoſe your reaſon; But if your will do but join with the juſter party, and if you will ſtronglie diſpute the Victorie; You ſhall no ſooner deſign the Conqueſt, but you ſhall be Victorious: Or to explain my ſelf more clearlie, you ſhall no ſooner be reſolved to abandone vice: and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Vertue, but you ſhall be Vertuous. perhaps you will ſay to me, that this Civill War, which will paſs without anie witneſſes but your ſelf, will not be glorious to you. becauſe it will not be known: But think not <hi>Theodates,</hi> that Vertue is a thing that can be hidden. You ſhall not ſooner be of its partie, but all the Earth ſhal know it. You ſhall gather no more Treaſures, but to enrich your Subjects: You ſhall not let your ſelf be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidged, but to reward them who Oblidge you: You ſhall reign over your People, with as much Equitie as Clemencie, you ſhal behold inveneration by all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces your Neighboures: You ſhall no more baniſh <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſontha:</hi> And your name ſhall be glorious, in all Ages to come. Behold <hi>Theodates,</hi> what Victorious fruits you may reap, which does not at all depend upon the caprice of Fortune, nor of the chance of armes: It is abſolutlie in your power. But to leave you the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, of aſſaulting and conquering this enemie, whom I have Crowned; I withdraw, and does yeeld all the glorie of the Combate to your ſelf.</p>

Yes, <hi>Collatinus,</hi> the perfidious <hi>Tarquin,</hi> whom you cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led your friend, when you brought him to me the firſt time that I had ſeen him; (and would to the Gods it had been the laſt day of my life?) That Traitor, I ſay, hath made Triumph of <hi>Lucretias</hi> chaſtity. By deſpiſing his own Glorie, he hath leſſened yours, by having abſolutlie benighted mine; Aud by a crueltie which never had example, he hath reduced me, to the moſt deplorable condition, that Woman whoſe whole inclinations are Noble, could ever ſee.

I am witneſs and aſociate of <hi>Lucretias</hi> crime. Yes <hi>Collatinus</hi> though I am yet alive I am not innocent: Yes my Father, your daughter is guiltie, for having ſurvived her glorie: Yes, <hi>Brutus,</hi> I merit the hatred of all my Neighbours: And when I have commited no other crime, but the giving love to a cruell Tirran, who by the abuſe he hath done to me; hath altogether violated the Laws of men of fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endſhp, offended the <hi>Roman</hi> People, and deſpiſed the Gods; It is enough to merit the hatred of all the World.

Revenge the abuſe that has been done to her, onlie for love to your ſelf, and not out of love her. Look upon her no more but as infamous: And though her misfortune be extream, deny her that compaſſion, which is had of all that are miſerable. But nevertheleſs, if it were permitted me, after I have ſpoken againſt my ſelf, to ſay ſome what in my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; I would ſay <hi>Collatinus,</hi> without contradicting truth; That I have not obſcured my Glorie, but by having loved Glorie too well. <hi>Tarquins</hi> cajolleries, did not touch my heart. His paſſion gave me none: His preſents did not at all ſuborn my fidelitie: Nor love nor ambition brangled my Soul: And if I deſired to ſpeak for my ſelf, I can onlie ſay, that I loved my Reputation too much. Yes <hi>Collatinus, Lucretias</hi> crime was that ſhe preferred fame to true Glorie. When the inſolent <hi>Tarquin</hi> came into my Chamber; I being awaked ſaw a Poiginard in his hand; And having brought it to my Throat to hinder my out-cries, he began to ſpeak of a paſſion he had for me; The Gods knows what were then my thoughts; And if death appeared terrible to me. In that condition I equallie deſpiſed the praiers and threats of the Tyrran: His demands and offers were equallie rejected: Neither love nor fear, had anie place in my Soul: Death did not affright me, And ſo far from apprehending, I manie times deſired it. My Vertue had nothing to fight againſt at that time: I was not pendulous to preſer death to the Tyrrans love: And I know no horrid pain, which I would not have joyfullie endured, to have preſerved my honour. But when my couſtancie had wearied the Tirrans patience: That he ſaw neither his praiers, tears, preſents, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, threats, nor death it ſelf could move my heart: That <hi>Barbarian,</hi> inſpired by the furies, ſaid it I reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his deſires anie longer, he would not onlie kill me; But to make me infamous to Poſteritie, he would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

I avouch with ſhame, that that diſcourſe wrought on my Spirit, what the certaintie of death could not do: I loſt ſtrength and reaſon; I yeelded to the Tirran; And the fear of being thought infamous, is the onlie thing that made me ſo. No, <hi>Collatinus,</hi> I cannot endure that <hi>Lucretia</hi> ſhould be accuſed, to have failled in her honour: That the memorie of it was eternallie blaſted: And thinking that ſhe ſhould be execrable to you, hindered her from dying at that inſtant, and makes her live till now. I did all things to oppoſe the Tyrrans violences, except killing my ſelf. I deſired to live, that I might preſerve my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and that I ſhould not die unrevenged: And a falſe image of true Glorie, taking poſſeſſion of my heart; made me commit a crime, which I feared to be accuſed of. However the Gods are my witneſſes, that my Soul and deſires are whollie pure, my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent contributed nothing to that doolefull accident, neither in the beginning, progreſs nor end of it. You know, <hi>Generous Collatinus,</hi> that when you brought the Tirran as your Friend, I was not voluntarlie the cauſe of his unjuſt paſſion; I ſcarce lifted up my eies to look upon him: And that Illuſtrious Victorie, which my Modeſtie gained to you that day, ſhould make you ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficientlie remember, that I have not drawn upon my ſelf, the misfortune that is befallen me. After that, I did not ſee the treacherous <hi>Tarquin,</hi> untill that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall day, wherein he made priſe of <hi>Lucretia.</hi> Vertue. But what do I ſay? Tirrans have no power over the will, I am yet the ſame <hi>Lucretia</hi> who ſo much loved glorie; Becauſe it is certain that mine is altogether innocent. The tears which flow from my eies, are not the effects of my remorſe: I repent not for the fault I have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but onlie that I died not before that of another. We were two in the crime, and but one Criminall: And my conſcience does check me of nothing, but my having preferred my reputation and revenge, to a Glorious death. That which hath cauſed my misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, is that I believed the Glorie of my death would not be known: I doubted the equitie of the Gods at that time: And without remembering that they do miracles when they pleaſe, and that they are protectors
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:31892:65"/>of innocence; I have lived longer then I ought becauſe I have ſurvived my chaſtitie. Think not <hi>Collatinus,</hi> that I will diminiſh my crime to appeaſe your furie; I ſee in your eies more ſplen againſt <hi>Tarquin</hi> then hatred to <hi>Lucretia:</hi> Doubtleſs you rather pittie then accuſe me, and all the former actions of my life, aſſiſt to vindicate me in your heart. And moreover, as I have ſaid alreadie, though I am unwillinglie guiltie, yet I conſent that <hi>Collatinus</hi> do love me no more. I ſpeak not this to flatter you; But onlie to carrie you the more ardentlie on to revenge. Me thinks, in vindicateing my ſelf, I make the Tirran the more odious: The more innocent I appear, the more guiltie he ſeems: The more unhappie I am, the more he deſerves to be, and the more tears I ſhed, the more blood you ſhould make him ſhed. Behold, <hi>Collatinus,</hi> the cauſe of my diſcourſe, of my tears and of my life. Let me not be ſaid to have lived infamous to no purpoſe: Think of revenge, Generous <hi>Collatine,</hi> conſider what you are, and what your enemie is, or to ſpeak better the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick enemie. You are a <hi>Roman,</hi> you are Vertuous, you are Noble; And if I dare alſo ſay ſo, you are <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretias</hi> husband. But for him he is of a ſtrange race, he is the ſon, and Grand-Son of Tyrrans. The Proud <hi>Tarquin.</hi> you know, mounted not the Throne, but by pulling a Vertuous Prince from it, whoſe Daughter he married. The Scepter which he holds, coſt the life of him who formerlie carried it: And to ſecure himſelf in his dominions, he has committed more crimes, then he hath ſubjects. Behold <hi>Collatinus,</hi> who is the Father of my raviſher. If I be not deceived his mother does not make him more conſiderable: For in fine, I cannot be live, that the ſon of the infam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Tullia</hi> who dared to drive her Chariot over her Fathers bodie, that ſhe might arrive at the Throne ſhe aſpired to; Had not ſo manie enemies at <hi>Rome,</hi> as there are Vertuous men in it. And more over, the Vertue of <hi>Sextus Tarquinius,</hi> did not deface the crimes of his predeceſſors: The beſt action that he did, was the betraying a great manie People, who truſted in him. Behold <hi>Collatinus,</hi> what an enemie you sis, go then, go and aſſault him couragiouſlie. You ſhall no ſooner ſpeak of the abuſe he hath done to me, but you
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:31892:66"/>shall have all the <hi>Romans</hi> on your ſide. It ſhall be both a Generall and Particular quarell to them: They will be feared for their Wives; Their Daughters; And their Siſters: They ſhall all look upon the treacherous <hi>Tarquin</hi> as their enemie: And if their yet remain anie who will follow him, they will certainly be cowardly &amp; eſteminate, whom it wil be no hard matter to overcome. The Senate waits but a pretext to declare themſelf: The People are wearie of carrieing chaines: They will ſeek a hand to unbind them: And the equitie of the gods ſhall favour your partie, You ſhall ſee that the Tirrans verie Relations, ſhall tear the Crown from off his head. Yes I ſee <hi>Brutus</hi> liſtening to me, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to revenge my abuſe: Doubtleſs he will follow you, in ſuch a generous deſign: And if the confidence whſch I have of Heaven deceive me not, I alreadie ſee the Proud <hi>Tarquin</hi> chaſed out of <hi>Rome;</hi> His infamous Son die by ſome unknown hand; And all bloodie fall in the duſt. (For I doubt if the gods will ſuffer him to die by ſo Illuſtrious a hand as yours.) Yes <hi>Collatinus,</hi> the Victorie is yours, I alreadie ſee all his Souldiers revolt, and all the Citizens mutiny. Hatred to the Tirran, and deſire of libertie, ſhall equallie preſs them: And would to the gods, that I may be the Victime, to obtain from their goodneſs, my countreys libertie. Yes <hi>Collatine</hi> all the Souldiers who are in his camp, who fight to day under his colours, ſhall become worſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to him, then they of <hi>Ardea</hi> whom he now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidges. Go then and make my misfortune known over all: And believe <hi>Collatine,</hi> that you ſhall not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh my crime, but onlie that of <hi>Tarquin.</hi> And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, I am verie certain, not to hear, what the People will ſay: For having been my own accuſer, my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, my partie, and my defender; I muſt be alſo my judge and Executioner. Yes <hi>Collatinus</hi> I muſt die: Do not tell tell me then, that becauſe my inclinations are innocent, I ought to live, that I might have the pleaſure of ſeeing how you revenge my injuries It is enough that you promiſe me: And therefore I can ſweetlie die; But I can have no pleaſure in life. There is a <hi>Lucretia</hi> within me whom I cannot endure: I muſt ſeparate from her, ſhe is inſupportable to me; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee her; I cannot ſuffer, her; I owe herblood to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:31892:66"/>the others juſtification, and to the revenge which you will take, When the <hi>Roman</hi> people ſhall ſee <hi>Lucretia</hi> killed by her own hand, becauſe ſhe would not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive her misfortune; They will the more eaſilie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that a Woman who loved glorie, better then life, was not capable, willinglie to loſs it. That laſt action ſhall juſtifie all mine: The blood which I ſhall ſhed, will beget Souldiers to you, to help your puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Tirran: And in this manner, I my ſelf ſhall aſſiſt to my revenge. My tears ſhall doubtleſs have ſome effect: And moreover, though I am unhappie, I dare believe that my death will trouble you. Yes <hi>Collatinus,</hi> Yes my Father, you ſhall be ſenſible of my death: And finding your ſelves oblidged both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to revenge the honor, and life of your Wife, and Daughter; You ſhall be the more irritated againſt the Tirran. Say not to me that my death is uſe-leſs, or that it will be evillie explicated. No, they who judge ſincerlie of affairs, will not take it for the effect of my crime: Remorſe doth ordinarlie ſhed more tears, then blood: And if I be not miſtaken death is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie of the generous or deſperat. Repentance is alwaies a ſign of weakneſs: And whoſoever is capable of having it, may live after they have f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I have the Authoritie of all ages for me; Which lets it appear, that almoſt everie day, they who have emploied their hands againſt their own life, do it onlie to diſſapoint Fortunes crueltie. To ſhun a ſhamofull death; Or to hinder themſelves from being ſlaves and not for their puniſhment. When we have erred, we are alwaies fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable judges to our ſelves: And there are few people who condemn themſelves to death. Let none tell me then, that the blood which I ſhall ſhed, will rather ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh my life, then deface what the Tirran hath done to it. No, <hi>Collatin,</hi> my intention is too pure, and the gods are too juſt, to ſuffer all men to be unjuſt to me. I die not through remorſe, or deſpair, I die with reaſon. I have told you what cauſes I have, do not then oppoſe my deſign, for you cannot hinder it. Think of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance and not of my preſervation: Becauſe the one may be glorious to you, and the other will be unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable.

You know it <hi>Virgilia,</hi> as well as I; Nor do I remember; all thoſe things, but for redoubling my griefe. Alace!

                     </gap>isfortunate for your Son.</hi> Wo is me <hi>Virgilia</hi> this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was but too true! For theſe ſame armes which he threw down to come to me, were emploied againſt him. Then did the Volſques take the Daggers in their hands, which they plunged in his heart: It was I made them undertake that deſign: I was of that conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy againſt him: For after I had ſurmounted my Son, I delivered him all unarmed as he was, into the hands of his enemies. Ah inſenſible that I was, could I think that it would be other waies! Was I mother of all the Volſques, to believe that for love to me they would yeeld the Victorie which they were readie to obtain? What right had I to ask from them the libertie of their enemie <hi>Rome.</hi> Should not I have thought, that they would revenge upon my Son, that loſs which I cauſed to them? Ah yes! <hi>Virgilia,</hi> I ought to have conſidered all thoſe things: And if <hi>Coriolanus</hi> could not return to <hi>Rome,</hi> I ought at leaſt to have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion with him in his diſhonour: And as he did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his reſentments in conſideration of me, I ſhould have quit my countrey for love of him. However we did not uſe him ſo: I did let <hi>Coriolanus</hi> depart environed with them who cauſed him loſs his life: And I return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Rome</hi> as in Triumph, to enjoy the fruits of that fatall Victorie. When at our return the Senate asked of us what recompence we would have for our action, we ought, <hi>Virgilia</hi> to have deſired the return of <hi>Corio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus;</hi> And not as we did, permiſſion to build a Temple to Feminine Fortune: It well appears, that that Divinitie hath not approved of our zeal; Becauſe it is ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us. The gods would have certainlie been the more agreeable, that we had been thankfull to <hi>Coriolanus:</hi> The Temple which is builded for us, is the effect of our vanitie, and not of our gratitude: We ſought our own glorie, and not that of our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator: Though to ſpeak truelie he merited it better then we: It was to the vertues of my Son, and not to our own that we ſhould have erected Altars: And he who could ſurpaſs his reſentments; Deliever his countrey; And yeeld the Victorie to his Mothers tears, without doubt meritted better then we, the honor which is done
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:31892:69"/>to us. Me thinks his pietie ſhould have had a more Favourable treatment from Heaven: For though there be ſome <hi>Romans</hi> ſo unjuſt, as to ſay that <hi>Coriola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> ſhould not have quitted his armes, but onlie for his countreys ſake, and not for mine: And conſequentlie bewrayed more feebleneſs then generoſitie, in that action; I am not of their opinion; And I hope poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will be of mine. That ſtrong paſſion which birth inſpires in them, who have a compleat Soul, is not cauſed by the Situation of the places where they were born: The ſame Sun gives light to all the Univerſe: We enjoy the Elements everie where: And if they have no ſtronger reaſon then that, certainlie it will be verie weak. But that which makes us love our countrey, is becauſe the Citizens, are all our Relations or Allyes. The intereſt of blood, or that of civill Societie, links us to them: The Religion, Lawes, Cuſtomes which we have common, makes our intereſts be common: But the firſt ſentiment that nature gives to them who love their countrey; Is to love it cheiflie, becauſe their Fathers, their Mothers, their Brothers, their Siſters, and their Relations are in it. Yes, I am verie certain, that the moſt zealous of all the <hi>Romans,</hi> returning to Rom, after along journey will not ſo ſoon look to the Capitoll, as to that place of the Town where his Mother or Wife dwelleth: Wherefore then, let ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e wonder anie more, that <hi>Coriolanus</hi> would yeeld to none but to my tears: For to whom among the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſhould he have been rendered? All who were ſent to him did abuſe him; He did not ſee in anie of them the mark of a true <hi>Roman:</hi> They were all ungrate to him: He could not in them acknowledge his countrey: He onlie ſaw the walls of <hi>Rome,</hi> but did not ſee his friends which he formerlie had there. Fear made all them ſpeak who were ſent to him: And it was onlie by me, that he did know he had yet in <hi>Rome,</hi> ſomething that ought to be venerated by him. We is me! Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, That ſuch extraordinar Pietie hath been ſo evillie rewarded, that ſo couragious a man, hath ſo lamentable ended his daies? That he ſhould be aſſaſinated by them who had choſen him for their Captain, and that the Place of his refuge, ſhould be that of his executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Alace, I ſay, that from my intentions which were
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:31892:70"/>ſo pure and innocent, there ſhould reſult ſo fatal an accident: However <hi>Virgilia,</hi> the Gods have permitted all theſe things; And yet I ſee no other reaſon, if not that <hi>Coriolanus</hi> and I, have too much oblidged the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> who have rendered themſelves unworthie. But in fine, <hi>Coriolanus</hi> is dead; And onlie dead for love of <hi>volumnia.</hi> Yet his death hath this advantage that it hath made them ſhed tears who cauſed it: For the Volſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques after the overthrow of their Captain, did hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

They gave him a Conquerours fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall; His memorie is dear to them: They hung above his Tomb numbers of Enſignes; And all the glorious ſpoills, which do uſuallis ſignaliſe the valor of theſe Illuſtrious dead, over whom they put them: And <hi>Rome</hi> which owes her libertie to <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> knows of his death without making publick mourning! She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members no more that ſhe had been loſt, and in ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie but for him: All the <hi>Romans</hi> were ungrate to him while he lived, they continue ſo after his death.

The vertue of <hi>Brutus,</hi> who without greif ſaw his Children die, is not of my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: That hard heartedneſs hath more ferocitie then Grandure of courage in it: There are ſome tears juſt; And compaſſion is not contrare to generoſitie: When I told <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> that I would love better to die, then to ſee him Conqueror of <hi>Rome,</hi> I ſaid nothing againſt truth: And when I alſo ſay, that I wiſh to be dead, and that my Son were alive: I ſay nothing againſt naturall equitie nor againſt <hi>Rome;</hi> I give to reaſon and nature, what I cannot refuſe them; And I take nothing from the <hi>Reipublick.</hi> I have ſacrificed my Son for it, and it
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:31892:70"/>may alſo ſuffer me to weep a little over the Victime which I have immolated for its preſervation: And that after I have done all that a true <hi>Roman</hi> could do, I may likewaies do all that ſorrow can exact from the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Mother. All they who loſs their Children have conſtantly juſt ſubject of weeping: yet they have for their comfort, the libertie of making imprecations againſt them who take away their lives: But for me, I not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie weep for the death of my Son, but I alſo weep, for being the cauſe of his death: And to increaſe my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, there is ane auſtere vertue, that will not let me repent for what I have done.

                  </gap>arbarous reſolution? No it is too contrare to nature and reaſon: I muſt greive; I muſt weep till death for the death that I was the cauſe of. It is not <hi>Romes</hi> enemie I regrate; It is he who was ſo manytimes prodigall of his blood, in purſuit of glorie whohath ſerved in the wars ſeventeen years, with incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable zeal: And had no reward but the wounds which covered his bodie. Further, Illuſtrious <hi>Roman Ladies,</hi> this mans birth doth not render him unworthie of your tears: he came of one of your Kings, and <hi>Ancus Martius</hi> his Predeceſſour, having carried a Crown, it might ſeem that he ſhould have had more right to the honors of the <hi>Reipublick</hi> then anie other; Becauſe he was incapable of uſeing it ill. But perhaps it was for that reaſon (ſome may ſay to me) that the <hi>Romans</hi> refuſed him the Conſulſhip, through fear that he would uſe it as a ſtep, to remount the Throne of his Fathers. No, this reaſon cannot be good; And there needs no more but the remembrance of <hi>Coriola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> his whole life, to make his intentions know. In that Battle which was given againſt the proud <hi>Tarquin,</hi> he made it verie well appear, that his ambition aimed no further, then to merit the Crown of Bayes, which the Dictator did put upon his head, without thinking of that of his Predeceſſors; For having ſeen one of out Citizens fall to the ground, he ſet himſelf before him to ſerve him for a Buckler: And covering his bodie with his own, he ſecured him from danger: And ſo well congregated his forces and valor, that he gave death to him, who would have cauſed his.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:31892:71"/>action would have ſufficed to hinder them, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſirous to have him paſs for a Tirran: Becauſe it is not credible that he would have ſo much expoſed himſelf, to ſave ſo ſmall a part of ſo great a bodie, if he could have been capable of framing deſigns to deſtroy it intirelie on day. But it is not in that encounter alone, that he hath made his zeal for the <hi>Reipuſlick</hi> appear. Is it not to be ſeen in all occaſions that offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Is it not ſignaliſed ill all the battles that have been given? Hath he ever returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> without bringing with him ſome of his enemies ſpoilles, or without being all covered with theirs or his own blood? Behold <hi>Virgilia,</hi> what a husband yours was: See Illuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Romans</hi> what my dear <hi>Coriolanus</hi> was, who in all his warlike actions, was never conquered but onlie by me. The Volſques themſelves, whom he afterward commanded, judged him not worthie of that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploiment, but becauſe by his hand, was that Victorie plucked from them, which they were readie to bear away, in ſpight <hi>of Lartius</hi> his reſſiſtance: Who going to aſſault the Town of <hi>Corioles,</hi> was ſo couragiouſlie beat back by the beſidged, that they put all our trophues to the flight, and all our armie into confuſion. That was the time, wherein the paſſion that he ever had for the glorie of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, made him ſurpaſs his own ſtrength, and by his example, forced ſome of ours to turn head to the enemie. This Generous deſign did ſo happilie ſucceed with him, that he repulſed them to the walls of the Town: and not contented with ſo brave an action; he would have perſwaded them who followed him, that the gates of <hi>Corioles,</hi> were not ſo open for theſe who fled, as for them to enter. But ſeeing their fear more prevalent then his diſcourſe, and that they thought more of retreating then fighting, this unfortunate whom I lament, did not forbear to purſue his deſign. There did he ſee himſelf almoſt alone, fighting againſt the whole inhabitants of a Town who fought through deſpair. There his hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wrought terror upon his enemies; His example reinforced the ſpirits of our Legions, and by the ſtrength of his arme he made them enter that fortified Town; And in fine made them over come thoſe who came to conquer them. It was onlie then by his
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:31892:71"/>courage, that <hi>Lartius</hi> had leaſure to rallie his trophues, to go and reap the fruits of that Victorie, by finiſhing what he had ſo happilie begun. And not being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, that the <hi>Conſull Cominius,</hi> who commanded the half of the <hi>Roman</hi> armie, might be in hands with them who were coming to relieve the Town whieh he had taken: He did cheerfullie re-take theſe ſame ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who having no deſire to ſhare in the hazard with him, were amuſing themſelves with dividing the bootie which he had acquired to them. But in vain did he ſet ſhame and glorie before them: So that ſeeing their cowardlineſs, he abandoned them, and onlie followed by them who would willinglie accompanie him, (which were but a verie ſmall number) went diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in ſearch of a new ſubject to his Valor. He arrived juſt at the Camp, in the inſtant wherein <hi>Cominius</hi> was going to give Battle to the enemie: And being all covered with blood and duſt, his arrivall did ſome what amaiſe the <hi>Conſull.</hi> But he had no ſooner given account of the action he had done, then the newes of his firſt Victorie did preſage a ſecond. All the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers reanimated their deſires of fighting, hope and joy adorned their foreheads; And onlie by the ſight of him, did they baniſh that fear which had ſeiſed their hearts. As for my Son, as if he had been verie ſorie, that anie other ſhould haue ſerved the <hi>Reipublick</hi> better that day then he, having asked the <hi>Conſull</hi> what trophues of the enemie were the beſt; An being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that theſe <hi>of Antiates</hi> were the moſt couragious, Becauſe the Volſques had put them in the front of the Battle; he deſired in recompence of his taking <hi>Corioles,</hi> permiſſion to fight them. You know Illuſtrious <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> that he obtained at that time what he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: That his arme couducted by the Gods, had the firſt honor of breaking the enemies Squadrons: that he alone did attaque an armie, thereby to ſhow the <hi>Romans</hi> how they muſt deſpiſe their life, to make themſelves Maſters of that of an other: And that his prodigious valor, had a ſucceſs which was likewaies ſo But when victorie had declared it ſelf for us, the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſull</hi> intreated my Son to conſider the condition he was in: And to remember that by the wounds he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, his blood dropped with that of his enemies.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:31892:72"/>But he anſwered him <hi>that Victores ought not to retire:</hi> In Teſtimonie whereof, joining effects to his words, he purſued them who fled even till night: And as he had been the firſt in the Battle, he was the laſt in the Retreat. It may be ſome will ſay to me, that deſire of reward inſpired my Son with that valor, but none can be ignorant that he refuſed everie thing that was preſented to him: On the contrare ſo great was his moderation, that after he had taken a town by force, gained a Battle, ſaved the Honor of the armie and of the <hi>Reipublick,</hi> he asked no recompence for his toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, but the libertie of one man, who had formerlie been his Hoſt and friend; And who was then priſoner of Was among the <hi>Romans.</hi> I remember verie well, that the name <hi>Coriolanus</hi> which he did bear, (O Gods! Can I ſpeak in ſuch termes?) I ſay I well remember that that name was given him at that encounter, to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe his action. But I alſo remember that the verie ſame People who named him <hi>Coriolanus,</hi> called him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the diſturber of the publick repoſe, the enemie of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Senates Tirran. Since that, what hath he not alſo done in an other occaſion? Certainly you remember of that fatall year, wherein it was thought that famine would have intirly deſolated <hi>Rome:</hi> When all the People Geminated, wherein hunger made triumph of the poor Peoples deaths, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the richeſt themſelves were expoſed to the like dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. You know, I ſay, that <hi>Coriolanus</hi> by his valor and courage, brought back abundance into <hi>Rome,</hi> revived the People; And all this with the price of his blood; And without deſiring other recompence, but that of having ſaved the lives of the Citizens. Nevertheleſs, for the reward of ſo manie ſervices; Of ſo manie brave actions; Of ſo manie wounds that he received And of ſo much blood that he ſhed: When he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Conſullſhip, which was granted to manie others, who did not merit it ſo well as he; They treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him as infamous, and as a criminall; they put him in the hands of the <hi>Aedilles,</hi> as the worſt of men, and baniſht him his countrey. O Heavens! Could I ask favour for them who treated my Son ſounworthilie, and how could that unfortunate Son conſent to me? Further after ſo manie abuſes that <hi>Coriolanus</hi> received,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:31892:72"/>what did he to revenge himſelf? Hath it been diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he deſired to ſuborn anie of our Conſulls? Hath he ſecretlie taken up money to make the armie of the Volſques ſubſiſt? Hath he furniſhed them with Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers? No, <hi>Coriolanus</hi> hath done none of all thoſe things: He was content for his revenge of <hi>Rome,</hi> to put onlie the faithfulleſt of the Citizens in the hands of his enemies. But if that deſpare which forced him to it, had ſucceeded happilie; that he had found more Humanitie in the heart of <hi>Tullus,</hi> whoſe Triumphing enemie he ſeverall times was, then in the hearts of all the People, for the glorie of whom he vanquiſhed the ſame <hi>Tullus,</hi> would anie, I ſay, that by an extream ungratitude, that he ſhould have abandoned him in a juſt War, and which he had undertaken in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him? Would any, I ſay, that to merit the baſe treatment, he received from them whom he had ſerved, had him betray them whom he protected: And who by a verie extraordinarie confidence had choſen him to be Generall of their armie? It may be ſome will ſay to me that <hi>Coriolanus</hi> did more hurt to the <hi>Romans,</hi> in accepting of that emploiment, then if he had ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borned the Conſuls of <hi>Rome;</hi> Then if he had taken up their riches: Then if he had made the People rebell, led an armie againſt his adverſaries: Becauſe it was ſeen that his perſon alone, joining with the Volſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques partie made an intire change in their affairs: And that they who had ſo manie times deſired peace with <hi>Rome,</hi> were in condition to make her dearlie buy it. But let none imagin that that was a ſimple effect of his conduct and valor. No, our Gods who are protectors of innocence, doubtleſs guided his arme, to ſubdue the pride of them who thought themſelves invincible not fearing to abuſe their Allayes. But in his happie ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, he did not forget that he was born a <hi>Roman,</hi> and though the Nobilitie abandoned it to the furie of the People, he did not forbear to preſerve their countrey houſes, againſt all the diſorders of War. He alſo had reſpect for them who were become his enemies; And though his particular Fortune was in a deplorable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he never asked anie thing for himſelf in the Articles that he propoſed, and deſired no unjuſt thing for the Volſques whom he protected. Behold once
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:31892:73"/>more, O Iluſtrious <hi>Romans,</hi> what <hi>Coriolans</hi> was: I recommend my Son by the picture I have made to you of him, preſerve his image in your heart: Remember that without his Generoſitie, the famin would have deſtroyed your Fathers, your Brothers, your Husbands, your Children and your ſelves: Or what would yet be word, that you have been formerlie, partakers of their chains and bondage. Let us not imitate Generous <hi>Romans,</hi> the ungratitude of our Citizens: Let us eterniſe the Glorie of our Sex to their prejudice: And for our gratitude let us Crown them with confuſion: This Temple which was granted to us, when my Son conſented to the favour we asked of him, ſhall not be ſo glorious to us, as the affection that you will teſtifie, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to preſerve the memorie of <hi>Coriolanus.</hi> You owe your tears to him who formerlie dried them up, and who hath broken your chains. You alſo ſhould (if I dare ſay ſo) ſweeten the bitterneſs of my forrow, by that which you will teſtifie for hls death: I have immolated my Son for love to you, you can do no leſs then afflict your ſelves for love to him. And as you ſhould have all carried mourning, if it had not been for my Sons Generoſitie: It is but juſt you ſhould all wear it, in honour of his memorie. Let us go then <hi>Virgilia.</hi> Let us go Generous <hi>Romans,</hi> to ask this permiſſion from the Senate. But O Gods! Can it be poſſibly, neceſſare to ask leave, to wear mourning for our Liberator? Yes the corruption of the age will have it ſo. Let us go then once more and ask with tears, the laſt thing that we can ſeek for my Son, becauſe he is dead. But for his Glorie, I am verie much aſſured that <hi>Rome</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed, when the Name of <hi>Coriolanus</hi> ſhall be ſpoken of afterwards.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Eing readie to quit the Court; And to go confine my ſelf in <hi>Paleſtina;</hi> I dare ſupplicat your Majeſtie, by the moſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable name of the Emperour <hi>Trajan,</hi> of whom you are come; By that of the great <hi>Theodoſius</hi> your grand-Father: By that of the equitable <hi>Arcades</hi> your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; And by that of the great <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> of whom you hold the Scepter, and whoſe pietie you imitat, to permit me this day, to tell you all that I think, both of my paſt and preſent Fortune: That I may at leaſt, have the ſatisfaction, at my departing from you, to be thought not to have whollie abandoned my innocence. Wo is me! If anie would have ſaid formerlie to the poor <hi>Athenais,</hi> when her Father <hi>Leontine</hi> the Philoſopher, taught her Vertue that hers ſhould be one day ſuſpected, ſhe could not have thought it. The ſimplicitie of her education, the little ambition that ſhe had, and the walls of the cottage that ſhe inhabited, ſeemed to ſecure her againſt Calumnie. Innocence reigned in her Soul, She was contented with her Fortune; She ſought after nothing but the acquiſition of Sciences and Vertue: And the ſole deſire of learning, and practiſeing good, was both
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:31892:76"/>her delight and occupation. But is it not this <hi>Athenais</hi> whom they accuſe: It is the unhappie <hi>Eudoſia;</hi> It is the Wiſe of a great Emperour; It is a perſon expoſed to the eies of a great Court; It is a perſon to whom na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath given ſome advantages, to whom Fortune hath given the firſt Crown of the World; And the love of the moſt venerable Prince of the earth. All theſe things, invincible Emperour makes my diſgrace the more ſeeminglie true: Great misfortunes are not ſeen but in the houſes of great Princes: Thunder falls oftner upon the ſtatlie Palaces of Kings, then upon Shepherds Cottages: And the Sea makes more Ship wrackes then the Rivers. It is no wonder then, if <hi>Eudoſia</hi> be more unhappie then <hi>Athenais,</hi> though ſhe be as inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent: And though ſhe be as Vertuous, under the Glorious Tittle that ſhe bears of Empereſs of the Eaſt, as ſhe was under that Name which her parents gave her. If Fortune, my Lord, had but robbed me of theſe things over which its domination extends; Had it pulled the Scepter from me which I carrie, after I had received it from your hands; Had it taken the Crown from off my head: Had your Subjects mutined againſt me, and tumbled me from the Throne as unworthie to have place upon it; I would endure that diſgrace without murmuring: Yes my Lord, that blind thing, ſo much accuſtomed to favour vice, at the expence of Vertue, that makes no preſents but to take them away; That eſtabliſhes no Kingdomes, but to deſtroy them; And which overturns all that it does eſtabliſh; In one word Fortune, ſhall not put a ſtand to my patience. I ſhall without regrate quit the Scepter, the Crown, the Throne, the Court, and the Empire, and all that ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did ſome which accompanies Royalltie, if I could return into my ſolitude, with your eſteem and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Theſe two things, my Lord, if I be not miſtaken, ſhould not be under Fortunes Juriſdiction: It may both take day and Empire from you, it may alſo make you a ſlave, but it cannot make your unjuſt. You alone are the arbitrator of your will, your hatred, your eſteem and your affection. The noble priviledge, that God hath given to man, of being free among chains, and of being abſolute Maſter of his inclinations, makes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:31892:76"/>my Lord, the reſpect I have to you, makes that I dare not accuſe you of theſe you have to me; Though certainlie, my innocence renders them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt: And for that reſpect I will rather call my ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie then ſay you are culpable. I accuſe Fortune unjuſtlie of one thing which you alone can anſwer; It is not from its hand, to ſpeak more trulie then I have done that I hold the Scepter which I carrie; It is not ſhe hath put the Crown up on my head; Her wheel hath not thrown me upon the Throne; Her caprice made me not your Wife; All theſe things my Lord, are either effects of your goodneſs, of my merit, or of your blindneſs. If it be the firſt, I have learned of my Father, that crime alone juſtifies repentance: That it is a ſentment which vertue knows not, and which ſhould not be uſed but after a wicked action. If it be the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and if you have eſtemed me, by knowing how little I am worth, take not from me my Lord, what belongs to me: Becauſe being the verie ſame that I was, you ſhould be the ſame that you have been. But if you ſay to me, that I am the error of your judgement and that you have not found in my perſon, ſuch merit as you did believe to meet with; I diſpute not againſt you, take from me all that you have given me, but take not away my innocence, which I have onlie received from Heaven. When <hi>Athenais</hi> came to your Court, her reputation was ſpotleſs: Few People that did ſpeak, ſaid all good of her. To day all People ſpeak ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their fancie, yet without letting me know what they ſay: For to ſpeak ſincerlie, it is onlie with you that I would be juſtified. They who do good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is good, and not becauſe it ſhould be divulged, care not what unjuſtice fame will do to their Vertue: They find their ſatisfaction on themſelves, without ſeeking after it in anie other: So that the wiſe are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times moſt innocent, and moſt happie, when the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar who onlie judge appaaentlie, believes them guilty and unfortunate. But my Lord, ſince the affection that you have had for me, and thrt which I have for you, hath made you (if I dare ſay ſo) a ſecond ſelf to me; I ought to vindicate my actions before your eies. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, my Daughter, ſaid my Father to me one day; That you ſtudie not ſo much to acquire the eſteem of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:31892:77"/>other, as not to endeavour more, to obtain your own. Be you both your own judge, and partie; Think of ſatisfying your ſelf; Examine your inclinations; Search the bottome of your heart, to knew if Vertrue be Miſtris of it: But do not flatter yourſelf, incline rather to rigor, then to indulgence. And after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made an exact ſcrutinie of your intentions, when you come to the point of being ſatisfied with your mind ſlight the glorie of the World; laugh at calumnie; And be better contented in having your own eſteem then if you had that of the greateſt Princes of the Earth. But my Lord, for this reaſon, I cannot be tranquill, ſo long as my better half doth not believe me innocent; Suffer me then my Lord, to repaſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actlie, all the circumſtances of my diſgrace, and that dear part of my innocence that I may thereby with ſome tranquillitie go to my ſearched for ſolitude. When I came to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> asking juſtice againſt my Brothers, who refuſed me that right which I had to the paternall Succeſſion, the prudent <hi>Pulcheria,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected not my requeſts: She heard me: And making me loſs my cauſe verie advantageouſlie gave me For tunes, which ſhe ought to have preſerved for me. At that time my Lord, there was onlie a poor cottage in agitation, and three foot of Earth to cover me from extream neceſſitie: But to day when not onlie the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of <hi>Anthenais</hi> is in queſtion, but that of <hi>Eudoſia</hi> your Wiſe, you are oblidged to hear her, and to do her juſtice. I think my Lord, that the cauſe of your anger and my grief is, becauſe I have given a trifle which you gave me: And that afterwards, to excuſe an action, which I ſaw by your eies, would not have pleaſed you if you had known it; I excuſed that innocent error by a lie. Behold, my Lord, all the crime that I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: And the fear onlie of diſpeaſing you, hath made me diſpleaſe you. When your Majeſtie gave me that fatal fruit, which hath cauſed my diſgrace, I receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with joy; Both for its extraordinar pleaſantneſs, and more becauſe it came from your hands. The pleaſure I had in ſeeing of it, perſwading me that it was more proper to divert the ſight, then to ſatisfie the teaſt; And being irreſolute to deſtroy it, I examined what I could do with ſuch an agreeable preſent: The unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:31892:77"/>
                  <hi>Paulinus</hi> was then ſick: So that being minded to ſend &amp; viſit him; I thought the amiable gift that you gave me, could not be better beſtowed, then by giving it to a perſon whom you teſtified that you loved better then your ſelf. But my Lord, <hi>Paulinus</hi> made not a miſterie of this liberalitie: For becauſe I did not tell him that I had received it from your Majeſtie, the ſame apprehenſion that had oblidged me to ſend him that fatall apple, was doubtleſs the cauſe, why to teſtifie to me the eſteem he had of the preſent I made him, he would put it in more worthie hands then his own. But if you ſay to me, that ſince you gave me the gift, I ought never to have regiven it, becauſe everie thing that comes from the perſon beloved, ſhould be held as dear as the life: I ſhall agree with you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by that I pretend to juſtifie my ſelf. However there is an important diſtinction to be made in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter: For as there is great diverſitie in mens loves, the things which that paſſion produces, ſhould alſo be all differing. The love of husband, and Wife, is no more that of Lover and Miſtris: And though they be the ſame perſons, and though love be as ardent in their hearts, as it was before their marriage; Yet their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinons are different in manie occaſions. They have more ſoliditie, and leſs affection; And none of all theſe follies which criminall loves do produce, are to be found in their Souls. So, my Lord, if <hi>Paulinus</hi> had had a paſſion for me, he would have keeped the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent which I made him, with care and with jealouſie: Since it is moſt certain, that in this kind of illegitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate affections, (which I never heard ſpoken of ſince I have been at Court) the leaſt things that comes from the perſon beloved, are ineſtimable Treaſures, which are never parted from, but with the life. However <hi>Paulinus</hi> no ſooner received my preſent, but he ſent it to you: And in that occaſion it may be ſaid, that he deſigned more to pleaſe you, then to content me. For me, my Lord, I never thought, you could take it ill, that I ſhould have given a triviall thing, which you gave me: And that liberalitie was a vertue, which I ought not to practiſe. For, my Lord, if I ought to give nothing but what I have not received from you, I muſt give my ſelf: Having brought nothing into your Palace, but
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:31892:78"/>that ſimplicitie and innocence. which ſome would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh me of to day. Why, my Lord, do your not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that by the innumerable riches that you have given me, I have diverſe times enriched ſeverall whole Towns? Why, my Lord <hi>Theodoſius</hi> hath permitted me to give Gold, Pearls and Diamonds, to a hunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people, who were unknown to him; And could I have foreſeen that he would have been diſſatisfied with my giving a ſimple fruit to the man in the World who had moſt profitable ſerved him, and for whom he had moſt affection? No, my Lord, that was not poſſible: And the wiſe <hi>Pulcheria,</hi> howſoever clear ſighted ſhe is, and is believed to be, and who fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees things from a far, had been deceived in it. But, my Lord if I ought to take care of anie nixt to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, it ſhould be of <hi>Paulinus:</hi> And if I dare ſay it, I owe more to him then to my Father, and more then to your Majeſtie; For my Father gave me nothing but life, and having received nothing from you but the Throne, I can ſay, <hi>Paulinus</hi> having inſpired me with the lights of faith, I am more oblidged to him, then to all the reſt of the Earth. Yes, my Lord, I owe the ſaftie of my Soul to him, and my eternall beatitude, if the innocence of the life that I ſhal lead, do make me obtain it. You know, my Lord, that it was he who converted me, that all your Doctors could not convince me; that only he unſeilled my eyes? And letting me ſee the abſurdites of my religion gained me to embrace yours. Believe then my Lord, that the birth of our Friendſhip had too holie a beginning, to be criminall in its progreſs? And that he who had opened the gates of Heaven to me, would never conduct me to the waies of hell. And moreover, my Lord, know that when <hi>Eudoſia</hi> ſhall again be <hi>Athenais;</hi> When ſhe ſhall I ſay, be again of that Religion, wherein all crimes are authoriſed by the example of the Gods whom ſhe adores: She ſhall not be leſs innocent. Chaſtitie is a Vertue which hath been known of all Nations, and through all ages; It is ſo eſſentiall to my Soul, that nothing can baniſh it thence. Judge then, my Lord, if being of a Religion, where modeſtie is rewarded, I could do anie thing againſt my dutie to you, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my dutie to my ſelf. I thing if I be not deceived,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:31892:78"/>that I have made you know, that I might have given with out crime what you gave to me: And at laſt that I have made you ſee, with a ſimiltude ſufficientlie true, that <hi>Paulinus</hi> his liberalitie to you; Juſtifies mine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. Now as to what concerns the lie that I made, in telling you that I had eat the fruit, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that I cannot deny, I would have done better to have told you the truth: But, my Lord, all follies are not crimes. When you ſpake to me at that time, I ſaw ſuch alteration in your Countenance, and ſo much choller in your eies: That fear of angering you having ſeiſed my ſpirit, I loſt my uſe of reaſon, Conſider, my Lord, that if there had been anie too particular affection, between <hi>Paulinus</hi> and me; Aſſoon as you had ſpoken tome, I might have wel judged, that you did know ſomething: And therefore, by an apparent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuitie, though artificiall; I ſhould have told you that I ſent it to <hi>Paulinus.</hi> But having nothing in my minde, that objected anie error!

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:31892:81"/>head, could it have been ſeeminglie true?

Yes, <hi>Flavian, Theotdoſius</hi> owes that Victorie to me, and alſo that which he gained of <hi>Baravanes</hi> King of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who being in league with <hi>Alamondar</hi> King of the <hi>Saraſins,</hi> had formed ſo ſtrong an armie, that doubtleſs there was more hen humane force need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to oppoſe that innumertable multitude of men, compoſed of diverſe Nations.

However, think not by what I ſay, that I would make you underſtand, the Empereſs is unworthie of the Throne: No, I will not deſtroy what I have eſtabliſhed: And I was not deceived, when I thought I ſaw in her a moſt extraordinare Vertue. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, <hi>Athenais</hi> is a miraele of nature: She is born with advantages, which I never ſaw but in her perſon: And if her Birth were as great as her Spirit, and if in ſtead of being bred in ſolitude, ſhe had been brought up at Court; ſhe had been incomparable in everie thing: But to her misfortune, ſhe hath begun, with what I am going to finiſh. Doubtleſs it is more eaſie to them who have a well accompliſhed Soul, to live gloriouſlie in ſolitude, after they have lived in the World; Then to go from ſolitude to domination. They who have known how to conduct manic People can certainlie lead their flocks without going aſtray: But all they who can induſtriouſlie uſe a ſheep-hook, cannot carrie a Scepter with honor. In fine, Kings may be Shepherds, but all Shepherds cannot be Kings. The Philoſophers alſo, who eſtabliſh themſelves Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain Judges of all the actions of men; Who beaſt of knowing the weight of Crowns; Who make imaginary <hi>Republicks?</hi> Who give laws to all the Earth? And who form Modeles, by which the greateſt Princes of the World ſhould Regulate their Lives and Governments: I ſay theſe men, who make Kings ſo perfect by their writings are not fit to Reign. <hi>Athenais</hi> gives me a domeſtick example of this? She knows Philoſophy: She is Daughter to a man who taught it her: She is born with all noble inclinations; She knows all that any of her Sex can know; She was without ambition when ſhe came to the Court; She has as much Spirit as anie bodie can have: But becauſe ſhe knows not the World but by looks, and becauſe her experience hath taught her nothing; Her ſimplicity hath made her liſten to <hi>Criſaphius</hi> his divices: And doubtleſs hath poſſeſt her with the opinion that ſhe has of me to day. All theſe things, <hi>Flavian,</hi> were not of my knowledge, when kindled in the Emperours heart, that flame which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:31892:82"/>me to day: But now I well know, that an active Philoſophie is requiſite to know how to reign: That experience is the ſureſt ſtudie of Kings; And I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo known by my own, that none can be perfectlie wiſe, but at its expences, and truly I ſhould not think it ſtrange, that the Empereſs do everie thing, to preſerve that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie which I have given her: It is ſo advantageous to her; That I alſo wonder ſhe doth not make it more, But as I have alreadie ſaid to you, the change that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to day, doth neither aſtoniſh nor trouble me: And I do yet preſerve ſo much affection for <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and ſo much eſteem for <hi>Athenais,</hi> that to hinder them from committing a publick fault, I will denude my ſelf of what power I had; Abandon <hi>Theodoſius</hi> to the affection that he has for the Empereſs: And abandon her to her little experience, and to the divices of <hi>Criſaphſus.</hi> I know not reverend <hi>Flavian,</hi> if my conjectures will be as falſe this day, as they were when I Crowned <hi>Athenais:</hi> But if I be not miſtaken, the reign of theſe Illuſtrious Perſons, ſhall neither be long nor happie. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placencie of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and the little experience of the Empereſs, makes me compaſſionate them: Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I alreadie ſee her, going to conſult her books, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the leaſt unexpected accident: But my Father, her books were not made for our Age: And if ſhe have not her judgement verie clear, that which was glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſhall be diſgracefull to <hi>Theodoſius;</hi> That which made him love, ſhall make this hate: And that which made him redoubtable, ſhall make this deſpiſed. The Throne whereon ſhe is to day is ſo high, that I fear her ſight is not ſtronge enough, to ſee the cottage again wherein ſhe did formerlie dwell. I fear, I ſay, ſhe will be tranſported, and abandoning the reins of State which I have forſaken to her, fall into ſome important errour. For me, I was never dazled by Grandeure: I am born among purples: The playes of my infancie paſt upon the Throne: And the firſt thing I learned was to reign over others, and over my ſelf. The wiſe <hi>Anthemius</hi> teaching me policie, which I have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilie enough practiſed ſince, told me one day, that to be never ſurpriſed at fortunes unconſtancy; We muſt always be prepared to endure, what others do undergo: And never to mount a Triumphing Chariot, without being
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:31892:82"/>prepared to be tied to it, if Fortune deſire it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Flavian,</hi> I ſhould not be ſurpriſed, if having partlie baniſhed the Empereſs into <hi>Paleſtina;</hi> She ſhould to day ſend me into ſolitude. The ſweet pleaſure that ſhe found there, without doubt makes her wiſh it to me: And it is onlie in gratitude, that ſhe deſires to be employed in that place which I did hold. When ſhe came to caſt her ſelf at my feet, and when by reaſons which would be too long to relate, I reſolved to make her Empereſs: I thought that that perſon, who eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſelf happie, in having a roof of ſtraw for riches would behave infinitlie, when ſhe ſhould ſee her ſelf reign over the heart of <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and ſet upon a throne, to which ſhe dared not to liſt her eyes. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever matters go not ſo; And ſhe who onlie deſired a ſimple cottage for her contentmemt, cannot find her ſelf in a great and ſtatelie Palace, if ſhe be not there alone, and if ſhe baniſh not her who opened the gates to her, and put her in poſſeſſion. It may truelie be ſaid for her excuſe, that ſhe does not believe, it was from my hands ſhe received the crown which ſhe carries: The aſſurance her Father gave her a dying, that ſhe ſhould be richer then her brothers, perſwads her that this Crown did fall from the higheſt heavens upon her head. She believes that the influence of the ſtars cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her good Fortune. And that I did nothing at that time, but what I could not hinder me from doing. She thinks I was conſtrained, by that conſtellation under which ſhe is born, to make her Empereſs of the <hi>Eaſt:</hi> And in this manner, believing that ſhe holds her good Fortune of the ſtars, ſhe thinks her ſelf thankful enough, when without looking upon me, ſhe hath onlie lifted up her eyes to Heaven. But wiſe <hi>Flavian,</hi> I who never believed all the miracles that have been told me of judicial Aſtrologie, who knows the uncertaintie of that Science: How miſtie and doubious are the predictions which it makes; And how unprofitable they are: I ſay, I know verie well, that I was not conſtrained to Crown <hi>Athenais.</hi> I deſigned it not without reaſon, I examined the thing exactlie. And becauſe it was of importance to me, I did not tumultuouſlie reſolve it: And it might have come to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:31892:83"/>the Planets and Stars. In fine, my Father, I well know, that this Science, whoſe predictions are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, untill the things come to paſs, is not a gift of Heaven: GOD did make nothing unprofitable in the World: And yet judiciall Aſtrologie is of ſuch a nature, that it oblidges me the more to believe its falſitie. Who is he that hath profited by the Propheſies have been made of him? Or to ſay better who hath underſtood them? Chance, that cauſed the Sponge be ſo fortunatlie thrown at the famous Painter, which accompliſhed without thinking of it, that which all his Art could not do, doubtleſs makes theſe occurencies, upon which the reputation of this Science is eſtabliſhed, ſometimes mervailious: But ordinarlie, they who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt accidents to Propheſie, muſt have more ſpirit then the greateſt maſters of his Art. When <hi>Lantiue</hi> a dying ſaid to <hi>Athenais,</hi> that ſhe ſhould be richer then her Brothers: The good-man ſaid it rather in praiſe of her beautie and vertue, then in aſſurance of the Empire. And if he had certainlie foreſeen, that the Crown which ſhe carries to day, was to be upon her head; He had but little judgement, to a muſe himſelf with dividing three or four foot of earth among his Sons: Becauſe it was verie credible, that if ſhe did become Empereſs, ſhe would not let her brothers live in the povertie of their birth, and conſequentlie the paternall Succeſſion would be of no uſe to them. Yes, wiſe <hi>Flavian,</hi> onlie I have made <hi>Athenais</hi> Empereſs of the <hi>Eaſt:</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I forgive her want of gratitude: And I wiſh with all my heart, that in fine ſhe may know the talent which Heaven hath given her. She is certainlie proper for great vertues: And if ſhe attempt but to Reign over her ſelf; She ſhall be the mervaill of her age. She ſhall reap more Palms in <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> then ſhe can acquire Glorie by the Government of affairs. And if I be not deceived, ſhe ſhall there be happier.

But let him remember, that at my parting from him, I leave all his Empire in peace; That all his ſubjects love him; That all his Neighbours fear him; That there is abundance in all his towns: That Vertue is ſeen in everie particular Familie; That vice appears no more among them; That his Court (except <hi>Criſaphius)</hi> hath no flatterers; That the Rable are without inſolence; That the great are without pride; And that pietie reigns in all the Temples of his Empire. Let him remember, Venerable <hi>Flavian,</hi> that that great vertue (if I dare ſay it) hath paſt from my heart into his; And from his, into that of all his Subjects, that thereby the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of me be not troubleſome to him: And alſo to the end, that if it come to paſs by chance, that he one day do recall me, as he hath recalled <hi>Athenais;</hi> He may ſee, if the Government will be then in the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I leave it in this day: As for the Empereſs, I ſhall be glad ſhe know, that though I have not made a particular ſtudie of Philoſophie, that though I be of a birth to exile others, and not to be baniſhed; That though I have ſome portion in the Throne which ſhe whollie this day poſſeſſes, I forbear not I ſay, to quit that Throne, and endure my exile, with more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration then ſhe teſtifies by receiving the crown which I gave her: I wiſh from Heaven, that I may know better how to uſe my diſgrace, then ſhe hath done her good Fortune: And to conclude this diſcourſe, remember my Father, you who have Governed my Conſcience, ſo long as I governed the Empire; That I never in my life propoſed anie other thing to my ſelf, then alwaies to do what I ought, and what I believed to be moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and moſt juſt. Veritable Wisdom conſiſts in the good uſage of what accidents befall us: There is no
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:31892:84"/>need of a ſcrupulous atachment to one Vertue: They muſt be all practiſed according to ſeverall occaſions. There is a time wherein humilitie is not laudable; And wherein Grandeur of courage is more neceſſarie: And others alſo wherein diſſimulation is Wiſdom: And Freedom criminall. We muſt know how to change ſeaſonablie, yet without ever changing the reſolution of doing what we ought. If a Prince with whom I have made a juſt War, ſhould by chance of Armes make me his ſalve; I ſhould then look upon him no more as my enemie, but as my Maſter; I would be faithfull to him in that condition; And renew the chains which he would make me carrie, if of Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they did break; Becauſe I could not break them without crime. It is by the ſame reaſon, wiſe <hi>Flavian,</hi> and by that ſame vertue, that without making factions in the Empire; Without cauſing the People rebell in my favours; And without making the Eccleſiaſticks remember, that I have ſeverall times deſtroyed Hereſie, and ſuſtained their Altars; Without I ſay doing anie of theſe things, I do reſolve after having known how to reign Soveraignlie enough; To obey with as much ſubmiſſion of Spirit, as I have had Grandeur of courage, in commanding the half of the World, from the age of fifteen years untill this day.</p>

Trulie <hi>Lepidus,</hi> everie time I remember what <hi>Ceſar</hi> hath done for the <hi>Romans,</hi> of the numbers of victories he hath gained, or againſt their enemies, or againſt their Tirrans; I immediatlie believe that my memorie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives me: And that it altogether preſents to me all the brave actions, that have been done ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Ages. I cannot, I ſay, think, that one and the ſame perſon had interpriſed ſo manic things, had accompliſhed ſo manic glorious deſignes had made ſo manic Conqueſts, had given ſo manic Battles, had ſo much hazarded his life, had eſcaped ſo manic dangers,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:31892:87"/>and had not lived longer then others. Nevertheleſs, <hi>Lepidus</hi> you know, that <hi>Ceſar</hi> hath done more then I ſay although he hath lived but fiſtic ſix years: And to recount onlie one part of his victories, and of the brave actions which he hath done before I undertake to juſtifie him, remember what he did in <hi>Spain.</hi> He ſubingated the Callaciens, and the <hi>Luſitanians</hi> even to the <hi>Ocean,</hi> where the <hi>Romans</hi> had never been. The conqueſt of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> you know, hath immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſed his glorie: For there in leſs then ten years, he did take either by compoſition or aſſault, more then eight hundred Towns, conquered three hundered different Nations; And having ſeen before him in ranged Battle above three millions of armed men in manic encounters, he killed more then one million, and did take as manic priſoners. (O <hi>Ceſar,</hi> O Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conqueror! Muſt the poigniard of an ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Traytor, make thee loſs thy life!) But I am not yet come to the laſt of his Victories: That famous Battle which he gave to <hi>Arioviſtus</hi> upon the banks of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> where more then eightie thouſand men died, makes it ſuſlicientlie ſeen that Conquerours are never wearie. Further <hi>Ceſar</hi> did not alwaies over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with caſe: He hath ſome times ſeen victorie flic above his enemies camp, and ſame altogether readie to publiſh his deſate: But his ſingle valour forced them to return to his partie. The adventure of the <hi>Nervianes</hi> makes what I ſay abundantlie ſeen: All the <hi>Romans</hi> were deſated, and the other were verie like to have been Maſters of the field of battle, when <hi>Ceſar</hi> did caſt himſelf alone, amidſt his enemies with his ſword in his hand, and a ſheild upon his left arm: And by an action worthie of <hi>Ceſar,</hi> deſerved to conquer theſe, who had almoſt conquered his People. After that, he was the firſt who paſſed the <hi>Rhine;</hi> He was the firſt who ſailed with an armie upon the Occidentall <hi>Ocean;</hi> He conquered <hi>England,</hi> which none believed was in being: And carried his armes and <hi>Romes</hi> Glorie, in places where the name of <hi>Romans</hi> had never been. The famous priſe of <hi>Alexia,</hi> is none of <hi>Ceſars</hi> leaſt actions: He ſaw in head of him, an Armie of three hundered thouſand men, to make him raiſe the ſiedge: But having as much prudence as courage, he devided
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:31892:88"/>his armie, and acted ſo skilfullie, that they who lived before <hi>Alexia,</hi> did not know there was a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full reliefe coming to the Town. They did not know I ſay, they were incloſed between two powerfull ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, untill <hi>Ceſar</hi> had defated them; And <hi>Vercingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torix,</hi> who was in that place, was rendered to that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Conquerour. Ah ſurelie! After that I doubt not but Hiſtorie will one day ſay, that he ſurmounted all ther Heroes: Yes, <hi>Lepidus,</hi> whoſoever would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the great qualities of the moſt Illuſtrious with him, will find that he hath excelled them. The <hi>Fabianes, Seipioes,</hi> the <hi>Metalles,</hi> and alſo they of his own time as <hi>Silla, Marius,</hi> the two invincible <hi>Lucullus,</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> are inferiour to him in everie thing: He ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted one by the difficulties of the countreys he conquered: The ſecond by the extent of the Nations which he hath put under the <hi>Romans</hi> dominion: The hird by the multitudes of enemies he hath defated: An other by the feirceneſs of the People with whom he had to do, and whom he behooved both to overcome and teach: An other in ſweetneſs, in clemencie, and in humanitie, to them whom he conquered: The laſt in magnificence and liberalitie to them who fought under him: And all of them in gaining manic battles, in defateing numbers of enemies, and in practiſing manic vertues. Behold <hi>Lepidus,</hi> the Victories which the <hi>Romans</hi> could not diſpute with <hi>Ceſar.</hi> They are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duable to him for all the blood that he ſhed in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny encounters he met with. It was for them that he fought; It was for them that he over came; It was for them that he conquered ſo manic countreys? And there were none to be found, untill the paſſage of that famous River, which <hi>Ceſar</hi> traverſed to come to <hi>Rome;</hi> or to ſay better, to come againſt the Tirran of <hi>Rome;</hi> I ſay there was none to be found but who did agree, that the <hi>Republick</hi> was much oblidged and indebted to <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar.</hi> But <hi>Lepidus,</hi> I intend to ſhow you this day that the other Victories which <hi>Ceſar</hi> gained, are theſe for which the <hi>Romans</hi> are more oblidged to him. I intend to let you ſee that <hi>Ceſar</hi> did never more ſtronglie teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the paſſion that he had for libertie, and the hatred that he had to tirranie; Then when he fought and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered <hi>Pompey.</hi> But to reſume the matter from its
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:31892:88"/>ſource, to juſtifie <hi>Ceſar, Pompey</hi> muſt be accuſed: And it muſt be ſeen, that as the one did alwaies teſtifie his being the Protector of libertie, the other, hath ſtill made it appear that he aſpired at Tirranie. All the World hath known, that <hi>Pompey</hi> did ſo manic things to uſurpe the domination, that to hinder him from interpriſing it any more they wereconſtrained to declare him alone Conſull: And the <hi>Romans</hi> at that time loved better to ſatisfie his vanitie ſome way, then to oppoſe directlie him. But they did not uſe <hi>Ceſar</hi> ſo, for ſo far from granting new honors to him, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ragiouſlie refuſed the juſt things that he ſought. <hi>Lentulus Pompeyes Parlyſan,</hi> diſgracefullie baniſhed <hi>Anthonie</hi> and <hi>Curio,</hi> who were conſtrained to diſguiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves like ſlaves, that they might return with ſafitie to <hi>Ceſar;</hi> And all that <hi>Lepidus,</hi> becauſe <hi>Ceſar</hi> by them did ask, the continuation of the Government of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> whom he conquered. The unjuſt refuſall that he got, did not carrie him to unjuſt deſigns: He did at that time know, that <hi>Pompey</hi> demanded not his return to <hi>Rome,</hi> but for his loſs; That <hi>Pompey</hi> looked upon him as his enemie; And as the onlie obſtacle that could hinder him from obtaining the Soveraign power, which he had ſo long pretended to. <hi>Ceſar</hi> did then conſider his particular preſervation, and alſo the publick good. He had a minde to diſarme his enemie, and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of <hi>Rome,</hi> and alſo diſarme himſelf. He then cauſed tell the Senate, to let the puritie of his intentions be ſeen, that he was readie to quit the Government of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> who had ſo often made him expoſe his life; That he was readie to lay down his armes; That he was readie to come and give account of his actions; That he was readie abſolutlie to renounce all kind of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, conditionallie that <hi>Pompey</hi> ſhould lay down his armes, as well as he, and that they ſhould both live as private perſons. Me thinks theſe propoſitions were not Tirranick: Tirrans never do expoſe themſelves to ſuch things: And <hi>Pompeyes</hi> Procedour makes what I ſay verie well ſeen. If <hi>Ceſar</hi> had propoſed to him to divide the Soveraign power with him, perhaps he would have more favourabllie heard him; But becauſe he deſired to put him out of condition of being able to aſpire anie more at Tirranie, he could not ſuffer ſo juſt
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:31892:89"/>a propoſition; He made factions to hinder the Senate from being brought to reaſon; And to wearie <hi>Ceſars</hi> patience entirlie, he cauſed as I have alreadie told you, and as you know, ignominiouſlie baniſh them whom he had ſent. He was treated as enemie of the publick good: And <hi>Pompey</hi> who ſought but to ſet affairs on ſire for <hi>Ceſars</hi> death, and to profit himſelf by the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of others, loved better to ruine his countrey, then to change his wicked deſigns. All the Senat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors found <hi>Ceſars</hi> propoſitions juſt: For he cauſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to them, that if they would have him quit his armes, and <hi>Pompey</hi> not quit his: It was to give him the means of arriving at <hi>Monarchie:</hi> But demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it ſhould be ordained for them both to quit, was asking a thing equallie profitable to all the people, and which ſhould not offend <hi>Pompey,</hi> if he truelie had no wicked intentions. his Father in law <hi>Scipio,</hi> and his friend <hi>Marcellus,</hi> liked not to conſent to it: And alſo they were almoſt the onlie men who hindered <hi>Ceſar</hi> from obtaining what he demanded: And did ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſpeak of <hi>Pompeys</hi> intereſt, that becauſe the Senate could reſolve upon nothing, publick mourning was ordained for that particular deſſention. Yet <hi>Ceſar</hi> was not wearied: He writ again to the Senate; He made juſt propoſitions to them a ſecond time: And both theſe times <hi>Pompeys</hi> faction was the ſtrongeſt. Further I know not how <hi>Ceſar</hi> can be accuſed, of having ſo much as dreamed to uſurpe the Soveraign power; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome time before the laſt injuries were done to him, <hi>Pompey</hi> having ſent to recall ſome Troupes that he had given him; <hi>Ceſar</hi> ſent them back without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſſed to it: Sufficientlie teſtifying by that action, that he feared not for the weakening his own forces, nor the augmenting thoſe of his Enemie: And did conſequentlie let them ſee, that he had no concealled deſigns: But morover, where are the great preparations of War that <hi>Ceſar</hi> hath made for ſo great an enterpriſe? Where are the intelligences that he hath practiſed in <hi>Rome</hi> or in anie other Towns: Where are his great Armies, or the manic Machines, for the battles that he muſt have given, or for the ſiedges he muſt have laid? No <hi>Lepidus, Ceſar</hi> had none of all thoſe things: And when <hi>Curia</hi> and <hi>Anthonie</hi> came to him diſguiſed
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:31892:89"/>as ſlaves, to acquaint him of the unworthie treatment he had received in their perſons, and of the wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns which <hi>Pompey</hi> had both againſt him and againſt the <hi>Republick:</hi> He had but five thouſand in fantrie; And three hundred horſe with him. Do you think <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidus</hi> that theſe Troupes were ſufficient if or a deſign of that importance? If <hi>Ceſar</hi> had had that intention, he would without doubt have Leived a much ſtronger Armie, he would have found pretexts for it; And he was more wiſe then to have undertaken ſuch a thing, without having a long time before ſearched outaway to make it ſucceed. It was not then apremeditated deſign that made him paſs that River, which he hath made ſo famous by his paſſage: It was both a reſentment of choller, of ſhame and deſpight, with an earneſt deſire to be revenged of his enemie, and to deſtroy a man who not onlie deſired to deſtroy him, but alſo deſtroy the <hi>Republick,</hi> He departed then without anie preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation; And the juſtice of Heaven conducting all his deſigns; He made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Italie</hi> in ſixty dayes, without ſhedding the blood of the Citizens. As to <hi>Pompey,</hi> it well appeared by his conduct, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe of conſcience made him loſs his good ſenſe: He was no more the great <hi>Pompey,</hi> who when he had none but lawfull deſigns, and when he ſerved the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publiek,</hi> teſtified ſo much prudence and ſo much cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. He loſt both the one and the other at that time: For though he had more Wariours then <hi>Ceſar,</hi> and though he had the advantage of being in <hi>Rome;</hi> He no ſooner underſtood, that he had paſt the <hi>Rubicone;</hi> But he fled in diſorder: without ſo much as giving leaſure for making ſacrifices to the Gods, to calme that florme. But the knowledge he had of his wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, doubtleſs made him believe, they would not be favurable to him: And there may be manic perſons found, who in ſo great a trouble will loſs that reſpect, which they alwaies did beat to them. Some did remember at that time, that he had been heard ſay, formerlie, <hi>that ſtricking the foot againſt the Earth would make Souldiers ariſe.</hi> That way of ſpeaking, which ſmells, of Tirranie, was he reproached with: And one of the chiefeſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſeeing his aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. boldlie ſaid to him; <hi>Now ſtrick the earth, to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:31892:90"/>oncreaſe your armie, that you may oppoſe Ceſar.</hi> He was alſo reproached of ambition and unjuſtice: And what was ſaid againſt him at that time, makes it ſufficently ſeen that <hi>Pompey,</hi> was the tyrran, that <hi>Ceſar,</hi> was the Protector. In effect he was no ſooner in <hi>Rome,</hi> then he courtiouslie treated all the ſenatores: he with a ſweet tenderneſs prayed them to Pacifie every thing; and again propoſed to them moſt juſt, and moſt reaſonable articles of peace, thereby to make them agree with <hi>Pompey.</hi> But they knowing that <hi>Pompey</hi> would be all or nothing; They did not make it, and excuſed themſelves to <hi>Ceſar.</hi> But <hi>Lepidus,</hi> when this Iluſtrious <hi>Heros,</hi> was created dictator, gave he any markes of his having deſires to aſpire at tyrranie. Non at all; He recalled the baniſhed; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed in honor the children of them who had been con fiſcated in the time of <hi>Silla,</hi> who was a Tyrran, and eleven dayes after voluntarlie demitted the dictatorſhip, contenting himſelf with being Conſulate, with <hi>Servilius Jſauricus.</hi> After that <hi>Lepidus,</hi> can any ſay that <hi>Ceſar</hi> was a tyrran, and that <hi>Pompey,</hi> was the defender of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie. But let us finiſh the giving account of his Illuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Life in few words, that we may have the more leaſure to Lament his death, Doubtleſs you remember all the artifice that <hi>Pompey</hi> uſed, to ſhun fighting with <hi>Ceſar,</hi> and draw affairs to delay: and they were ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly viſible, and his ambitione ſo known, that his verie ſouldiers boldlie ſaid, he continued not the warr, but for to continue his authority, In effect, he knew that either victorious or conquered, he muſt quitt the ſover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aign Power, or altogether take of the Maſk, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed him to the halph of the <hi>Romaines.</hi> But <hi>Ceſar,</hi> whoſe confidence was in the equity of his cauſe, and in that of the gods, ſearched after his enemies He ſeared not to aſſault and ſight him; He had nothing in his heart that reproached him of crime; He knew that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged <hi>Rome,</hi> by revenging himſelf; And by freeing himſelf of an adverſarie, He freed <hi>Rome</hi> of a tyrran. His hope of heaven did not deceive him: He gained the battle and <hi>Pompey</hi> loſt it. That man who had been ſo much favoured by fortune whille he was innocent, was abandoned by it when he became Criminal. He did not anie more know aither to fight or overcome; nor did ſomuch as know how to be overcome like a man
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:31892:90"/>of courage, Howſoon his partie had gotten the worſt in the battle of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> in ſted of annimating them by his example he went into his tent, without knowing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt what he ſaid: And knowing that affairs went ſtill worſe for him, that his entrenchments were forced And that <hi>Ceſar,</hi> approached, <hi>what</hi> (ſaid he all fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) <hi>even in our Camp,</hi> and after he had ſpoken in this mannner, he again fledd, and abandoned all that remained of his Partie. Yet me thinks it would have ben more glorious for him to have died by <hi>Ceſars</hi> armes then by the ſword of the traitour <hi>Septimius,</hi> who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merlie commanded under him: But this great man, having in his heart, hatred, remorſe, repentance; ſhame of being overcome, and ambition; We neid not wonder if loſing hopes of reinging, He, in fine loſt his reaſon, But after we have ſeen that <hi>Ceſar</hi> was skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the art of conquering, I pray you <hi>Lepidus</hi> let us look if he did alſo know the uſe of victorie; if he was inhuman or clement; If he was juſt or rigorous? If he was tyrran or <hi>Romane</hi> Citiſen. How ſoon the field of battle was left to him, and the eagerneſſe he had to fight was mitigated when he ſaw ſuch multitudes of dead ſouldiers round about him, he ſhedd ſo many tears, as he had cauſed them ſhedd bloud: <hi>O gods,</hi> (cried he weeping,) <hi>Ye know it was their desyre and that they Compelled me to be their conqueror! For Ceſar after having gained ſo many Illuſtrious victories, doubtleſs would have bein blamed, if he had abandoned his armie.</hi> Any other Conqueror but <hi>Ceſar,</hi> would ſhedd tears of ſoy, after having gained the battle: But for him, He could not rejoyce in his Victorie, becauſe it had coſt the lives of ſome of his citiſens. Believe me <hi>Lepidus,</hi> Tyrrants do not weep for their ennemies: And clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and pitty are ſentiments which they know not at all. However you know that <hi>Ceſar,</hi> almoſt pardoned all his: He alſo had a particular care to cauſe ſearch for that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious man, who afterwards cauſed him loſs his life: And when the traytor <hi>Brutus,</hi> rendred himſelf to him, he treated him as if he had bein his ſon: Woe is me! me thinks I ſee my dear <hi>Ceſar,</hi> going from rank to rank aſking from his people news of <hi>Brutus,</hi> looking among the dead bodies, if he was not yet there in condition to be ſuceoured, and doing all things poſſible to ſave him,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:31892:91"/>who by a horrid ungratitude, thruſted a poigniard into his breaſt. <hi>O gods!</hi> is it poſſible that <hi>Ceſar,</hi> could make ſo bad a choice? That among all the <hi>Romans</hi> he loved his murtherer, better then any other, and that the <hi>gods</hi> who teſtified their having ſuch particular care of his life, did not advertiſe him, that he whom he loved beſt of all men, ſhould of all men be the moſt cruell againſt him. But it is not yet tyme to ſpeak of <hi>Brutue,</hi> his ungratitude; The clemency and the goodneſs of <hi>Ceſar,</hi> furniſhes me With too good a ſubject to leave it ſo ſoon: And to let his affaſinates cryme appear as great as it is, his vertues muſt appear with all the ſplendour that they had. Tyrrans have ſome times put a pryce upon the heads of their enemies, they have promiſed abolitione of all ſorts of crimes to theſe who would bring them: And ſometimes when they have been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, they have looked upon that fatall preſent with joy. But <hi>Ceſar,</hi> uſed not his ſo; He would not ſee that of <hi>Pompey;</hi> He weeped bitterlie; He treated him igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniouſly who preſented it to him, and forced him to the neceſity, of making his recourſe to flight, thereby to ſave his life. For me, I find that actione more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious for <hi>Ceſar,</hi> then if he had overcome <hi>Pompey:</hi> But though he was alone to weep for his enemie; He was not alone to fight. Further, He well teſtified that He did not ſo much regaird <hi>Pompey,</hi> as to his own Particular, then as to that of the Republick? For he not only pardoned all them of his partie who would render themſelves? But he took a particular care of all <hi>Pompeys</hi> friends: And by that made it ſeen that he hated not his perſon, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that He deſyred to deſtroy his unjuſt and pernicious deſſignes. Any other but <hi>Ceſar,</hi> after having been victor, would have conſidred his own ſecurity; By baniſhing ſome, by puting others to death, and by putting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a condition to defie the reſt.

After that, in one ſingle day, he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf Maſter of three Camps; killed fiftie thouſand men; And loſt but fiftie Souldiers. In your opinion <hi>Lepidus,</hi> was it <hi>Ceſars</hi> arm that fought ſo, or rather was it not that of the Gods? That Illuſtrious victorie made him no more inexorable then the reſt: For when he was told, that <hi>Cato</hi> was killed by his own hand? <hi>O Cato!</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>how I envie thy death, becauſe thou haſt envied my glorie of ſaving thy life.</hi> Perhaps ſome will ſay, that if <hi>Cato</hi> had lived. <hi>Ceſar</hi> would not have done what he ſaid: But it is eaſie to imagine, that he who pardoned <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> who carried armes againſt him, would have alſo pardoned <hi>Cato.</hi> But <hi>Lepidus</hi> I will have none judge of <hi>Ceſar</hi> by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I have of him; I will have none judge of <hi>Ceſar</hi> by what his friends will ſay of him; But I will onlie have them judge of him by the honors that the <hi>Romans</hi> have done to him, dureing his life, and after his death. And truelie, it was not without reaſon that there was a Temple of Clemencie builded in acknowledgement of his; Becauſe there was never a conqueror, who did ſo perfectlie know the practiſe of that vertue. But pray you tell me <hi>Lepidus,</hi> how is it poſſible that theſe ſame <hi>Romans,</hi> who ſince the ending of the Wars, could not reprocah <hi>Ceſar</hi> of anie act of Soveraignitie; how is it I ſay poſſible, that theſe verie men who build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Temple of clemencie, by the knowledge they had of his goodneſs, could call him Tirran; It might be found in Hiſtorie, that Triumphant Arches have been erected for Tirrans: That by their orders, and by their violence, their ſtatues have been placed upon the Altars: But that by a voluntary gratitude, Temples have been builded to their glorie, and Temples of Clemencie; Is that which will not be found in all Ages, and wich wil be found of <hi>Ceſar:</hi> For in fine, he
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:31892:92"/>was no Tirran, and doubtleſs, merited more then was given him. Do you not remember <hi>Lepidus,</hi> of the day wherein he cauſed redreſs <hi>Pompeyes</hi> ſtatues, and wherein <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid, <hi>that by re-elevating the, he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eured his own:</hi> That action was then found as brave, as it was; All the <hi>Romans</hi> ſpake of no other thing, and all did agree, that <hi>Ceſar</hi> was the moſt Illuſtrious of all the <hi>Heroes,</hi> And trulie at that time <hi>Ceſar</hi> ſeemed as juſt as generous: For whereas theſe ſtatues were erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>Pompey,</hi> in the time that he ſerved the <hi>Republick;</hi> He would have no mark of honour taken from him. which he did effectuallie merit. Further Tirrans are never in ſafitie: They fear everie thing, and truſt themſelves to no bodie: They judge themſelves wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of a violent death: And by the pains they take to ſhun it, they make it appear that they know they merit it.

That he had followed his friends counſell at that time: But he was too Generous, to be capable of ſuch prudence, as does ſo ſtranglie reſemble fear, that it does verie often produce the ſame effects. And moreover, he thought that having made known to the <hi>Romans,</hi> the ſinceritie of his intentions, he ſhould have no need of anie other proviſion for his ſafitie. He loſt not one ſingle occaſion of teſtifying to them that he preferred the qualitie of a <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: As you know, when he returned one day from <hi>Alba,</hi> when ſome did ſalute him, they called him <hi>King;</hi> But he anſwered them, <hi>that he was named</hi> Ceſar <hi>and not King.</hi> Yes, <hi>Ceſar</hi> you had reaſon to prefer that name to this of King: You have rendered it ſo famous that you cannot quit it without loſing by the change: You muſt having lived <hi>Ceſar,</hi> die <hi>Ceſar.</hi> Do you alſo remember <hi>Lepidus,</hi> that when the Senate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cered new honors for him, he ſaid with an extream moderation, <hi>that his honors had rather need of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinched then augmented:</hi> Nor are you ignorant, that when <hi>Anthonie</hi> by an inconſiderate zeal cauſed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Royall <hi>Bandeau</hi> to him, he twice refuſed it: And commanded it to be carried to <hi>Jupiters</hi> ſtatue:
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:31892:92"/>As if he would have ſaid, that the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould onlie be commanded by the Gods. What could he do more at that time to teſtifie to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that he aſpired not at Tirranie, then Publicklie to refuſe the badge of Royaltie? Would anie have had him cauſe put <hi>Anthony</hi> to death for that cryme? No that would not have been juſt: and he who had pardoned his enemies of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered crymes, ought alſo to pardone a raſh zeal in on of his friends. I well know that <hi>Pompeys</hi> partiſans have ſaid, that <hi>Ceſar,</hi> contributed to ſome exceſſive honors that were done to him, thereby to eſſay the peoples good will: But know, <hi>Lepidus,</hi> if he had contributed to them, his refuſeing of them would have been with deſigne, to juſtifie his intentions, Ah, <hi>Lepidus,</hi> to ſpeak truelie of the matter, the friends, flatterers, and enemies of <hi>Ceſar, are they who equally oppreſſed him,</hi> with the Crowns of flowres, that they did throw upon him The firſt by exceſſe of affection: others, by the deſyre of pleaſing and making themſelves great, and others, by deſign of giving pretexts to the people, to murmure againſt <hi>Ceſar;</hi> And of having ſome coulor for the villanies which they under hand deviſed againſt him. But tell me, <hi>Lepidus,</hi> what other thing could <hi>Ceſar</hi> doe, then refuſe the honors that were offered to him! More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over if <hi>Ceſar,</hi> had a deſyred to be King, it would not have been impoſſible to him: That ſame arm that made him conquer ſo many countreyes, and gain ſo many victories, would have ſecured the Empire to him. He was too well inſtructed in worldlie affairs, to belive that by meekneſſe, and the ſuffrage of all the <hi>Romans,</hi> he could arrive at the throne: Doubtleſs, he knew that crowns are taken by violence, and are never given: And if he had intended to make himſelf King, He would have uſed force and not meekneſs. France would have furniſhed him with ane armie ſtrong enough for that: And if with five thouſand foot and three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred horſe he put <hi>Pompey</hi> to the flight, and made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf maſter of all <hi>Italie;</hi> It would not have been more difficult for him after the battle of Pharſalia, to have uſurped the ſoveraign authority. The <hi>Gaules,</hi> would have followed him with joy, and would have come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Rome,</hi> to retake the bootie, which the <hi>Roman</hi> Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ns had for merlie taken from them. In fine <hi>Lepidu;</hi>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:31892:93"/>He would have acted like a tyrran, and uſurper, and not like a citizen. I do avouch that <hi>Ceſar,</hi> deſired to reign, but it was in the <hi>Romans</hi> hearts, and not in <hi>Rome:</hi> He did them everie day new favours; He conſidered onlie their felicity and their glory: And in the verie time wherein they were meditating his death he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed all his pains to make them live happily. <hi>Lepidus,</hi> was there ever a more Iluſtrious Heroe then <hi>Ceſar?</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs all his life with himſelf, you ſhal not find on ſingle blemiſh, but you ſhall their find all vertues in the higheſt degree the victorys which he gained were not of thoſe which fortune gives blindlie to them who confide in it abſolutlie: He gained them both by valour and reaſon: and when he gave any thing to chance, it was becauſe reaſon would have it ſo. The ſtadefaſtneſs of mind, that he alwayes teſtified, in all the dangers wherein he expoſed himſelf for the republick, is ane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible thing: He ever beheld good and evil fortune with the ſame countenance. Love, Choller, Hatr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Revenge, and Ambition, did never make him guilty of anie imbecillitie: He was alwaies.

Nevertheleſs, there are men, there are <hi>Romans,</hi> who have been ſo wicked, as to look upon <hi>Ceſar</hi> as a Tirran.

Ah let none ſay to me, that the more ungrate he appeared to <hi>Ceſar</hi> the more thankfull did he ſeem to his countrey: No, <hi>Lepidus</hi>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:31892:93"/>Generoſitie is not compatible with ungratitude, Vice and Vertue cannot be together: And none can be ungrate and thankfull equallie. Whoſoever receives an obligation engadges themſelves to the perſon oblidg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Therefore they who have a high ſpirit do never receive benefits but from their friends: and in the choice of the two, they love better to oblidge their adverſaries, then not to be oblidging. If <hi>Brutus</hi> could not have lived happie, while <hi>Ceſar</hi> was alive, he ſhould have alwaies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared under his enemies coulors; He ſhould have refuſed all the honors which <hi>Ceſar</hi> gave him; He ſhould not have rendered himſelf to him; And rather then to have received that life which <hi>Ceſar</hi> gave him, he ſhould with his own hand have killed himſelf, as the generous <hi>Cato</hi> did. But having received his life from <hi>Ceſar;</hi> Having accepted the firſt offices of the <hi>Republick;</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that by a kindlie reſentment, <hi>Ceſar</hi> had preferred him to <hi>Caſsius;</hi> That he ſhould have let him ſelf been perſwaded by Caſſius, to ſtab <hi>Ceſar;</hi> Is that which cannot comprehend; Is that which cannot be approved off by anie rationall perſon; And is that which could not have been glorious to <hi>Brutus</hi> although <hi>Ceſar</hi> had been a Tirran. Nevertheleſs <hi>Lepidus,</hi> that was the ungrate, this is that Traitor, who was chief of the conſpiration, who gave him his deaths wound. Why <hi>Brutus!</hi> Why cruell!

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:31892:94"/>intention: And ſay that if <hi>Ceſars</hi> innocence, could be queſtioned, by the actions he did dureing his life, it hall be fullie juſtified by what is come to paſs at his death, and after his death. The extraordinare care that the Gods took to advertiſe him of the misfortune that was to befall him, lets the puritie of his Soul be ſufficentlie ſeen: All thoſe ſigns which appeared in Heaven; Thoſe defective Victimes, thoſe dreams which frighted me; The hands of theſe Souldiers which appeared in fire; He who Prognoſticated to him that the <hi>ides</hi> of <hi>March</hi> would be fatall to him; And all theſe other things which thought to impede the effects of the conſpiration: makes it abundantlie known that <hi>Ceſar</hi> was not an ordinaric man. If <hi>Ceſars</hi> death could have been for the good of the <hi>Republick,</hi> the Gods would not have given ſo manic preſages of it. They foretell misfortunes, thereby to make men ſhun them; But of the felicitie that they ſend them, they never give ſo manic ſigns.

Further who did ever ſee dead Tirrans vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated? When they are alive they are feared, but when they are dead, their bodies are dragged through the publick places; they are torn in pieces: The laws which they have made are changed; Their ſtatues are demoliſhed; Their memories are in execration; And they who killed them, live inſaſtie and with honour. But for <hi>Ceſar,</hi> all dead as he was, he hath been reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: The places which were marked with his blood, were worſhiped by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and ſeemed to be ſacred Nis bloodie Gown all peirced with the wounds he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, excitted ſorrowin the Souls of all the Citizens: His Teſtament which enriched them all, was given carto as that of the Father of the countrey: The People made him a pile, more Glorious for his memorie, then if they had given him the nobleſt funerall, that Kings are honored with: Becauſe this was an effect of his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; And that becauſe the ſame fire that did conſume my dear <hi>Ceſar,</hi> deſired to embrace the houſes of his murtherers. The Senate changed none of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:31892:94"/>which he made; They gave him new honours; All his aſſaſinates took the flight, and by an univerſall conſent, he was ranked among the Gods. Who ever faw a Tirran deified after his death? <hi>Alexander</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who was the greateſt Prince of all Antiquitie, did not paſs for <hi>Jupiters</hi> ſon, but dureing his life: But <hi>Ceſar</hi> hath that advantage above this Illuſtrious <hi>Heres</hi> that what <hi>Alexander;</hi> freinds did while he was alive, the witneſſes of <hi>Ceſars</hi> merit have done to him, after he ceaſed to live. The Gods alſo, after they had given ſiniſter preſages of his death, deſired likewaies to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; That it had infinitlie offended them. That terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying <hi>Comet</hi> which appeared ſeven whole days after his death, was alreadie a ſign of the vengeance they would take: The Sun alſo that was a whole year, without giving his accuſtomed hear and brightneſs, has made it known to all the earth that by <hi>Ceſars</hi> death, the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick</hi> had loſt its greateſt ornament and beſt luſtre: And alſo to teſtifie his innocence better, the vengeance of Heaven hath pertinaciouſlie purſued even to death, all them who onlie by their Counſells, had contributted anie thing to that unjuſt conſpiration. They all died violent deaths, without ſo much as one eſcaping; They found to Element, where they could live quietlie; The Sea was fatal to them as well as the land, they who eſcaped the furie of their enemies, killed themſelves with their own hand; <hi>Caſſius</hi> peirced his own heart, with that ſame ſword, wherewith he ſtruck <hi>Ceſar;</hi> And in that manner, he is puniſhed with theſe ſame armes with which he committed the crime. <hi>Brutus</hi> you know ended his dayes that ſame way: And in fine I know that none of <hi>Ceſars</hi> murtherers, remains anie more in the World.

It is truellie, by that mean, that you can give him immortality, and alſo give it to your ſelf: It is for that, that <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> his age can call it ſelf happy: And I mantain it to be more glorious for the <hi>Emperour,</hi> to be beloved of <hi>Virgill,</hi> of <hi>Horace,</hi> of <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> and of the famous <hi>Mecenas,</hi> who is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of theſe favorites of <hi>Apollo;</hi> then if he had bein feared of all the earth. Fear by rendring him redoubta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all nations, doubtleſs would have made him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed while he was alive: But the praiſes of <hi>Virgil,</hi> and of <hi>Horace,</hi> ſhal render him venerable to all ages to come. Certainlie <hi>Mecenas</hi> if all Kings were truelie inſpired with deſire of glorie, they ſhould carefulie conſider, how to acquire the affections of them whome the gods have choſen to diſtribute it. It is by hiſtorie and poliſie, that they can obtain the immortaliſing of their names: And that they may pretend to conquer after their death both time and fortune.</p>
               <p>But betwixt thoſe two famous waies that conducts to eternitie, <hi>Poeſie</hi> ſeems to have a particular priviledge to deifie men: It is whollie Celeſtiall and divine; The fire that it animates doth purifie and clarifie all them whoſe Elogies it makes; And without abandoning truth, it excuſes faults, and makes good qualities ſeen with all the advantages they have. Hiſtorie demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates to us vertue all naked, and Poeſie adornes it with its beſt ornaments. Hiſtorie is ſo ſcrupulous, that it dares not determine anie thing: It gives aſimple narrative of things. but doth not judge them: But poeſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:31892:97"/>it ſpeaks of: And to ſpeak all in few words it hath equally the advantages of Hiſtorie and Eloquence: And diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes abſolutlie of that immortall Glorie, which is the nobleſt reward of all the <hi>Heroes</hi> toillings. Further, a Hiſtorian looks upon ſo manic things, that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that the Prince whoſe reign he deſcribes, be not as it were inrolled among the number of his ſubjects. He owes his pen as well to all the criminalls of theſe times, as to all the Illuſtrious: He has not the libertie of chooſing his ſubject: He muſt take it as fortune and tyme do give it to him: And the prince and his ſubjected are ſo ſtrongly mingled together, that almoſt He can never been ſeen, But in Armies, in publick places, and and in a popular multitude. On the contrare, the Poet, ſeparates the Prince from the people; He chooſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In fine the hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans object is ſimplie veritie: And that of the poet is the glorie and immortalitie of his <hi>Heros.</hi> You ſee I do not much differ from your thoughts: And that the converſation of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and <hi>Meccnas,</hi> have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me knowledge enough, in everie thing that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns Poeſie, to ſpeak rationallie of it. Wherefore, I think I may ſay, that Kings ſhould employ all their care, to make themſelves beloved of poets: And that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> is more oblidged to you, for the freindſhip of of <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> then for your having conſtrained him not to denudehimſelf of the <hi>Empire</hi> that he poſſeſſes Doubtleſs <hi>Alexander,</hi> had reaſon, to envie <hi>Achilles</hi> his deſtiny, becauſe he had the advantage, of having <hi>Homer</hi> to proclame his glorie; But <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> ſhall have non to complain of his age, becauſe the gods have given him for freinds, <hi>Virgile, Horace</hi> and <hi>Mecenas.</hi> However I certainlie mantain, that he hath ſome ſubject to accuſe fate, for having compelled him to baniſh <hi>Ovide.</hi> Yet you know to excuſe the Emperor, the regrate that he teſtified; And how much pain he had to refuſe you his pardon. I avouch <hi>Mecenas,</hi> that I fear the baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch a brave ſpirit, will one day be a greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> then all the proſcriptions of the Triumvirate. Theſe men who can illuſtrate or denigrate the whole life of a great Prince, ſhould me thinks be

But when a Poet who is truelie worthie of that name, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes the protection of a <hi>Heroe;</hi> He is in condition to defie, envie, time, and fortune. Nothing can anie more obſcurate his reputation; His protector refutes all his enemies; And from age to ages, He renewes his life, and acquires for him a new ſplendour. The writtings of <hi>Virgil</hi> and of <hi>Horace,</hi> ſhall not onlie be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious for <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> by the places which ſpeak of him; but by everie thing that will be admired, in theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Authors. They who read with aſtoniſhment, and admiration, <hi>Virgills</hi> divine <hi>Eneides,</hi> ſhall find the loſt of his Prince, worthie to be envied by all the Monarchs of the World; In having meritted the praiſe and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, of the moſt excellent man, that all ages have ever produced. The who ſhall read <hi>Horace</hi> his works will find them verie advantageous to <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> in hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meritted the good will of a man, who could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct the ſpirit ſo agreeably to vertue, by reprehending of vice: Yet to have had a greater ſhare in his <hi>Odes</hi> then in his Satyres. Everie time that I conſider the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and charmes of Poeſie, I become the more paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate of it; And if the decencie of my Sex would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me, I would ſay that <hi>Didoes</hi> chaſtirie pleaſes me leſs in Hiſtorie, then her weakneſs and deſpire does in the <hi>Encides.</hi> Judge then <hi>Mecenas,</hi> if they who can render vice ſo agreeable; Cannot make vertue appear with all the Ornaments: And if they who can impoſe Fables, cannot perſwade to truth. You know <hi>Mecenas,</hi> that ſome are bold enough to affirme, that the <hi>Scaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> is but a rivolet; And that <hi>Troy</hi> is of the number of things which never have been. Yet <hi>Homer</hi> found cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in all Nations: All the <hi>Heroes</hi> whom he introduces in his <hi>Iliades,</hi> or into his <hi>Odyſes,</hi> have their friends and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:31892:98"/>partiſans: And the trueſt hiſtorie doth not ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſs his Readers, as the one and the other of theſe mervailous works. Let Princes learn then from thence, that they who can ſo well immortaliſe their fancies and imaginations, can with much ſtronger reaſon make them live eternallie, when they render them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves worthie of it, both by their merit and by their Benifices. Doubtleſs it belongs to them to publiſh the Victories of their Princes: But it alſo belongs to their Princes, to make them reap of the fruits of their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories. They who ſay that the Muſes deſire not abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance: And that ſolitude and povertie are not unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for the production of their works; Perhaps will loſs that opinion when they know that the liberalities of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Mecenas,</hi> have not hindred <hi>Virgill</hi> from making of Maſter peices; <hi>Horace</hi> from acquiring Univerſall eſteem: And <hi>Titus-Livius</hi> from having merited a glorie which ſhall not die. In effect it is eaſilie comprehended that they who do brave things, when they work but for neceſſitie; Will do miracles if they work onlie for glorie. Such a Noble object will exalt their ſpirits to the verie heavens: Whereas ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs diſturbs the hearts, and makes them rampe upon the earth. All the watchings they employ, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of fortune; in accuſing the unjuſtice of their age, in blaming the ignorance of the times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they live: And in publiſhing the avarice of their Princes; Doubrleſs would be emploied in more famous ſubjects. I know verie well, that ſolitude, fountains, rivers, groves, and woods, have been alwaies looked upon, as places proper for the compoſition of fine works: But if all thoſe things do belong to him who makes them, I do not ſee that it can be anie obſtacle to his glorie: And if I be not miſtaken, he ſhall better deſcribe the beautie of his own praierie, then that of an other; The ſhades of his own woods ſhall defend him better from the ſcorching heat of the Sun, then theſe of his Neighbours: The noiſe of his fountains ſhall yeeld him more agreeable fancies, then thoſe of the publick can give him; a river to which he hath ſome right, will ſeem more proper for his making a fine deſcription, then if he looked upon it with an indifferent eye: And in fine ſolitude, which is not by conſtraint,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:31892:99"/>will certainlie afford more agreeable <hi>Ideas,</hi> then theſe whereto he is forced. It is true that ſhepherds cottages renders peſantry moſt agreeable: But painters when they are skilfull, do alwaies place them a far of; So then to do things according to reaſon, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oets muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee a roof of ſtraw, but in their journeys, or from the windows of their Palaces. For it is not to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that a man who paſſes all his life time incem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſlie, in chagrine and ſolitude; Can ſpeak of abundance which he hath not, of Magnificence which he ſees not, of the Court which he never frequents, of Kings whom he knows not but onlie by their names, of war which he hath not ſeen but in books, and of a great manic other things which are ſtrange and new to him, if it be true that he is poor and ſolitarie? Believe me <hi>Mecenas,</hi> Poets in ſuch encounters are like painters, who reprefent nothing perfectlie but what they ſee. Great Princes then muſt alwaies have them to be witneſſes of their actions, if they would have them leave tablets of them to poſteritie. For it is not to be thought, that they to whom juſt ſubject of complaint is given, can elegantlie praiſe them whom they do ſecretlie accuſe in their heart? It is not to be thought I ſay, that they who praiſe for gain, do praiſe ſo arduouſlie as they who praiſe for thanks? No <hi>Mecenas,</hi> that cannot poſſiblie be ſo. Further, as dreams are ordinarlie formed by the thoughts of the day, ſo theſe agreeable tranſportations which Poeſie gives to them who medle with it, when they are happie; Loſſes all their brightneſs by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors chagrine, when he is not, but alwaies laments his evil fortune. He would do well to ſtrive to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from himſelf, for he is ſeen by all; He carries his diſcontent even into the hearts of the <hi>Heroes,</hi> whoſe lives he writs; And does not writ one verſe which his heart doth not ſecretlie diffavow. In fine, <hi>Mecenas,</hi> I am perſwaded that a rich Poet, lodged in a ſtatly palace will with more eaſe make apicture of povertie and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; Then a poor lodged in a cottage, ſhall make of the magnificence of the Court, of the vertues of Kings, of policie, and all thoſe other things, which are not perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie learned, but in the ſocietie of men &amp; in abundance. There is this difference between the rich and the poor, that the one are ſolitarie when they pleaſe, that they
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:31892:99"/>have rockes and caves when they will: And the others cannot have a palace, and that their ſolitude is forced. And moreover, who can comprehend? That Poeſie which is the Nobleſt effort of imagination, may not ſome way need beautifull objects, either to excit, to divert, or to recreat it? They who have aſſigned woods and rocks to the Muſes, have doubtleſs been of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, yet without making their conſideration deſtroy mine. They have ſpoken of foreſts and rivers, becauſe theſe univerſall beauties are in the power of all the World: But that doth not hinder, that theſe ſame Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes who ſearch the woods, may not walk in a cultivated Garden. Art doth not ſpoill Nature, it perfectionats it: And <hi>trees regularlie</hi> planted, hinder not if I be not deceived, the Poets from working under their <hi>Ombrages</hi> with pleaſure and with glorie. It is true, <hi>Mecenas,</hi> that theſe nine famous Siſters, from whom our Muſes draw their Origine, had no habitation as is ſaid, but woods and mountains, and did not devert themſelves but beſide fountains: Yet theſe woods, theſe moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and theſe fountains, belongs to them: <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> is of their dominion: The waters of <hi>Parmeſſa</hi> are alſo theirs; And <hi>Apollo</hi> nor the Muſes, borrow nothing of other divinitie. After all <hi>Mecenas,</hi> it is for the Grandour of Princes, not onlie to know how to conquer their enemies in war, not onlie to know how to reign dureing peace; Not onlie to make themſelves to be feared of their Neighbouts; Not onlie to make themſelves be beloved of their ſubjects; But alſo to make themſelves ſurpaſs all other men in liberalitie. They muſt give like Maſters of the Univerſe; They muſt when they make preſents, look rather to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, then regard others; And proportionat their gifts to their own Grandour onlie. They who receive go halfes with profit, but ordinarlie they have no ſhare in glorie. It belongs whollie to the giver: And to ſpeak rationallie, the moſt glorious conqueſts that Kings can make, are theſe which they make by liberalitie. In war, ſucceſs is alwaies dubious: There is no battle ſo advantageous in its beginning, whoſe end may not be fatall: But here we are alwaies aſſured of Victorie: A liberall Prince doth equallie make to himſelf, ſlaves, ſubjects, and friends of them to whom he gives: And
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:31892:100"/>this is the onlie way whereby he can merit the rank of the Gods. But among all men, Princes ſhould chooſe for the principall object of their liberalitie, theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous diſpenſatores of glorie, yet with this difference, that what is pure liberalitie at other occaſions, is grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in this? For what is not due to them who give im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalitie. They have been formerlie, ſtupide, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and covetous Princes, who have let the Muſes languiſh in povertie, without giving a juſt ſubject of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment. But if <hi>Auguſtus</hi> having ſuch inſights as he hath, in all brave Sciences; Loving fine works at the rate he doth; Making Poeſie his divertiſement; Being a lover of glorie, as he hath alwaies made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; And making of things himſelf, which may place him in the rank of the moſt Iluſtrious Authors: I ſay, if <hi>Auguſtus</hi> having all theſe advantages, do give but meanlie, to the profeſſours of good learning, he ſhall be diſhonored by it, and it ſhould be almoſt leſs ſhameful for him, to be both ſtupide, ignorant, and avaritious, then to be knowing and not to be liberall. But thanks to the Gods, his inclinations and your counſells, have well hindered that blemiſh from poluting one of the ſpeciall paſſages of his life: And to know if <hi>Auguſtus</hi> hath known the price of all brave Sciences, we need but conſider the rewards he gave to them who practiſed them. But among all them who are carefull of this mervaillous Art, which the Gods have taught to men, it muſt be avouched that they whoſe ſpirits are ſublime enough, for being capable to undertake a Heroick Poem, deſerve the firſt rank near Kings: And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it is principallie of them, that they ſhould have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular eſteem. For of all the various ſpecies of Poeſie which we admire, this work is the greateſt, the moſt Illuſtrious, the moſt Difficile, the moſt Glorious, both for him that makes it, and for the <hi>Heros</hi> whom he chooſes. To ſpeak rationalie, and Epique Poem, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains whollie in it ſelf, all others beauties, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more. They who make Elogies, do eterniſe rather their miſtriſes, their paſſions, and their languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, then the merit of their Princes: We ſee but ſhort tablets in <hi>Odes,</hi> wherein the moſt part of things are not diſtinguiſhed: One ſingle action is ſometimes too ample a ſubject for that work: And its limits, in fine,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:31892:100"/>are too much contracted to boaſt of its having conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red time and fortune. Eglogues can do no more, then make posterite imagine, that the reigne was fortunate, dureing which the Muſes might employ themſelves, to make ſhepherds ſpeak, and not in complaining of thevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of their Kings.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Satyres,</hi> theſe bold painters, wherein all the world find their picturs; Cannot be glorious for Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but when their images are not found in them: And to ſpeak more clearlie, their ſilence is the greateſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie that they can give, <hi>Epigrames</hi> for the moſt part, are but ſparkles of diamonds, whoſe brightneſs though ſplendid, cannot furbiſh the life of a great prince: They are a ſimple paſtime of the ſpiritr and of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination: which at moſt, cannot preſerve but the glorie of him, who hath fortunatlie acquited himſelf of that ſort of work; A Tragedie, which is certainlie one of the nobleſt employments of the Muſes, although it do bragg of teaching by its diverting, and though it paſs among the moſt learned, for the Maſter-peice of this art; Yet ſhould not be ſo conſiderable to a Prince, as a heroick poeme. He who makes Tragedies, works more for himſelf then for his King: He makes tablets, but his Maſter can pretend to have no other glorie in his work, but that, of haveing known all the beautie, of preſerving theſe rare paintings with care, and in buying of them magnificentlie. It is not ſo with ane Epique Poeme: It is truelie it, that deifies Princes, for whom they are compoſed; all their vertues appear ſplendidlie there; Their conqueſts are there painted forth in their fineſt luſtre: Their faults if they have anie are skill ſullie minced; fortune, victorie, and fame are allwayes of their partie; They have no enemies in it whom they excell not; They are happie, in warr, and in love; Their ſplendour, contrarie to cuſtome, returns from them to the Origine of their race; And whereas chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren did uſe to dervie their glory from that of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours; on the contrarie, here the predeceſſours, extract their greateſt advantages from the vertues of their Children.</p>
               <p>The goodneſs of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> cauſed <hi>Virgil,</hi> eterrniſe the pietie of <hi>Aeneas:</hi> The conqueſts which he made, ſhall make theſe of his fore fathers live eternally: It is for
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:31892:101"/>love to him, that this great Poet hath conducted that Illuſtrious <hi>Trojan,</hi> even upon the throne: And to ſpeak tru lie, it is he who hath ſaved him from the conflagrations of Troy, with his father, and his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick gods: Becauſe without him, doubtleſs, He ſhould have continued buried under theſe mightie ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines: At leaſt poſterity ſhould no more have heard his valor ſpoken of, then if he had never been.</p>
               <p>It belongs then to Princes, to make a dilligent ſcruting thorow all their provinces, after them who are capable of ſuch a noble occupation: To the end that having found them, they may b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She gained them all to be of her opinion and by a prodigious hardineſs, they did undertake to croſs the <hi>Tyber</hi> by ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

When they were before him, he asked them who had been the firſt among them, that propoſed ſo dangerous an enterpriſe: But they all imagining that he only asked but for to puniſh her, none of them would anſwer. Then this Generous Maid, took upon her the diſcourſe, and almoſt ſpake to him theſe words.</p>

Do not think that what hindered them to name me, is a remorſe of what they have done. No, they do not doubt my enterpriſe having been juſt? But they doubt
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:31892:104"/>will be generous enough to reverence vertue in your verie enemies. For me who am uncapable of fearing anie thing, if it be not the loſs of my honor, I tell you again, that it was by my counſels, by my care, and under my conduct, that theſe generous <hi>Romans</hi> reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to go out of your power; And abandone them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the impetuouſneſs of the water to follow me;</p>
               <p>And couragiouſlie expoſe their lives, to deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the fear of ſuffering ſome treatment unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of their vertue. Why! Illuſtrious <hi>Romans,</hi> (ſaid I to them, to encourage them to caſt themſelves in the river, as I did propoſe to them) can you put your lives in the balance with your honour: And in fear of loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the one or the other, can you have anie trouble in chooſing? No, no (purſued I) your are <hi>Romans,</hi> and my companions: And conſequentlie too Generous, not to love better to put your ſelves in hazard of dying gloriouſlie then of living with infamie.</p>
               <p>Who did ever hear it ſaid (inſiſted I) that Virgins were in good repute in a Camp, where ſhame and modeſtie are not to be found? We are in ane armie, continued I (which I hope your Majeſtre will pardon me for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo) whoſe General, is Protector, of the <hi>Tarquines:</hi> It is for them that King <hi>Porſenna,</hi> hath undertaken the warr: And by what means then do you think to find a place of faſtie with a Prince, where <hi>Lucretias,</hi> raviſher hath found a refuge and a defender? No, my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, flatter not your ſelves: If the blood of that chaſte unfortunate had not power to hinder a Prince from oppoſing the revenge that the <hi>Romans,</hi> were taking? Our tears will never prevail with him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge us of them who would abuſe us.</p>
               <p>It may be you will ſay to me, that we were given to him in hoſtage, and that the publick faith is engadged to him by our perſones: But know my companions, that whatſoever is done for honor, cannot but be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p>We will not break the peace; we will not cheat <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenna;</hi> we will onlie ſhun ſhame and infamie, or die with the ſame glorie wherein we lived.</p>
               <p>Let us go then, Illuſtrious <hi>Romans,</hi> ſo long as we have libertie.</p>
               <p>Heat the noiſe, that the Souldiers make in their campe, and be a feard of their inſolence.</p>

               <p>They are altogether ſouldiers, ſtrangers, our enemies and the defenders of the <hi>Tarquins</hi> Conſider in fine my companions, that in the place where you are, you may loſe your honor: But in that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I will conduct you, you can loſe but your life.</p>
               <p>Behold, <hi>Porſenna,</hi> a part of the reaſons I uſed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade theſe Generous Virgins to follow me; And I ſhall ſay for their glorie and for that of my countrey, that it was eaſie for me to perſwade them to my incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. I was not contradicted in my opinion: They looked death in the face with conſtancie, and quitted the banks of the river with joy, though according to all liklie hood, they almoſt ſaw their death aſſured. But becauſe our intentions were moſt innocent, the Gods did take care of conducting us; They aſſiſted our feebl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they ſuſtained us upon the waters, and happilie brought us to the other ſide. Yet we did not find there all the repoſe that we expected: For that auſtere ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which all the <hi>Romans</hi> do profeſs, made our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations have no joy at our return: They admired our reſolution, they have alſo praiſed our deſign: But to ſatisfie the publick faith that they had engadged to you, they would have us brought back to your Camp: And for that effect, they have given us a convoy to conduct us hither, See <hi>Porſenna,</hi> by this adventure, what the <hi>Roman</hi> Virgins are, who loved better to hazard their life, and break their word, then expoſe their honour: And again ſee, what the <hi>Roman</hi> men are, who love better to expoſe the lives and honour of their Daughters, then to break their word. Yes, <hi>Porſenna,</hi> theſe two actions are equallie praiſe worthie: And to be juſt at ſuch a time, we render to our parents the ſame honours which they gave us. They haye praiſed our flight, though they have not foreborn to remit us into your hands: And we alſo admire their vertue, though it deprives us of that libertie which we had acquired to our ſelves. The deſign of preſerving our honour, cauſed our flight: And that of not lofting their reputation hath cauſed out return. Perhaps you will ſay to me, that it will be hard to comprehend how one and the ſame action can be both worthie of praiſe and of blame; And in fine that our return is an infallible ſign, that our flight was cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall. No, <hi>Porſenna,</hi> the buſineſs ſhould not be ſo
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:31892:105"/>conſidered: It muſt be better examined, to judge of it equitablie. And I am verie certain, that if it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded with an unintereſſed eye, it will be found that our flight was glorious to us, and that our return is ſo to our parents, I avouch that in ſome manner, we ſeem to have broken the publick faith: But before we be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of that fault, I muſt be permitted to defend our cauſe. Doubtleſs it cannot be denied that honour ſhould be the rule of all the actions of men: It is for it that life is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in war! It is for it that ſometimes all the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Nature are renounced: It is for it that men do voluntarlie devout themſelves to the ſafety of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: It is for it that the publick faith is exactlie keeped; And in fine, it is for it that all tings ought to be done. Wherefore, let none wonder, if for preſerving our honour we have expoſed our lives, and broken the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick faith. For ſeeing it is not keeped but onlie for honour, it was permitted to us to violate it; Becauſe we could not keep it, but by expoſing our ſelves to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie. Further, ſince our Sex is deprived of all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick charge, as to our particular we had promiſed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: And we thought, that for the iutereſt of <hi>Rome,</hi> we ought to have gone out of your camp, becauſe if mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune had happened, to us it might have ſuffered an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If <hi>Mutius</hi> did couragiouſly burn his hand; If <hi>Cocles</hi> be entitlie devoted to the publick ſafitie; If <hi>Brutus</hi> gave the blood of his children, for theſe two things onlie; We have alſo expoſed our lives for the ſame cauſe, and may conſequentlie pretend to the ſame glorie. Why, <hi>Porſenna, Lucretia</hi> hath me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited an immortall reputation, for having killed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf after her crime, and are we laughed at as in famous, for having expoſed our lives, to the end that we might die innocent? No, no, it is impoſſible that it ſhould be ſo: Poſteritie will be more juſt: And I do verilie believe, that if you examine your thoughts exactlie, you will find that they do not condemn us. We have never ſeen that the gods who are ſo jealous of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, have cauſed Thunder fall upon the Victimes, which eſcape from the Altars: And wherefore them <hi>Porſenna,</hi> would you unworthilie treat Virgins, who having ſeen themſelves abandoned of their guards, or to ſpeak better their enemies; Went in queſt of ſaftie, at the expence of their lives? Perhaps it will be ſaid to me, that it ſeems by my reaſons, that we had no wrong done to us: But if it be ſo, it ſeems likewaies that our parents had no reaſon to ſend us back. yet this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is not well grounded: And if I be not miſtaken, I ſhall deſtroy it in few words. <hi>I</hi> have alreadie told you, that honour cauſed our flight, and that this ſame honor hath cauſed our return: For to ſpeak rationallie, it was our Fathers who engadged their words to your; It was they who gave us in pledge, it was they who treated with you; It was they who conſented to the articles of peace; And it is alſo they, who ſhould exactlie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all that they promiſed to you, thereby to oblidge you to do the ſame thing, The publick faith engadges
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:31892:106"/>them to it: the publick intereſt deſires it; Their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys honor requires it; Their own in particular oblidges them to it. and in fine nothing can exempt them from it. For they verie well know that theſe ſame Virgins, who have deſpiſed the impetuoſitie of the Tyber, onlie through fear of receiving an abuſe; Will again contemn their lives, rather then do anie thing unworthie of <hi>Roman</hi> vertue; And in that manner ſhall they keep their word, without hazarding their honour or that of their countrey. See, <hi>Porſenna,</hi> what our Parents opinions are, and alſo what ours are: It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs now to you, to conſider if you will treat us like fugitives, like enemies or like <hi>Romans.</hi> Yet I hope that you will take the juſter and moſt advantageous partie. But know, that if by violating the lawes of men, you ſhould treat us unworthilie, and break the peace that you have made, your deſigns ſhall advance no further then they have done. That which <hi>Mutius</hi> and <hi>Cocles</hi> did undertake againſt you a thouſand <hi>Romans</hi> ſhall yet attempt. They are all born for great actions; All of them have an obſtinat vertue, that bluſhes at nothing: Deſpaire does nothing, but corroborate their courage; Fear of death is unknown to them, They, endeavour to live with glorie and not to live long; Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular intereſt can do nothing in their ſpirits; They do everie thing for honor, and do never anie thing that can blaſt it. See <hi>Porſenna,</hi> what the <hi>Romans</hi> are: See what ſentiments they have given to us: And ſee in fine, that which hath both cauſed our flight and our return. it is true that at firſt flight, I had great repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancie to return under the power of a Prince, whom til then I had not conſidered, but as the protector of the <hi>Tarquins,</hi> and as the enemie of <hi>Rome:</hi> But coming to ponder the matter with a more tranquill ſpirit; That laſt quality did begin to give mea better opinion of you. Yes <hi>Porſenna,</hi> I found that you muſt doubtleſs have a great and bold ſpirit, in having attempted to make war with <hi>Rome:</hi> And conſequentlie I believed. that if you had not been worthie of the rank that you keep, the <hi>Romans</hi> would not have made peace with you, and would not have received you into their Aliance. So that after I had perſwaded my companions to go out of your Camp; I have likewares perſwaded them to return <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cit. Let us go (ſaid I to them) let us go, and ſatis fie
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:31892:106"/>the publick faith, which our parents have engadged: Let us go and confirme the peace that they have made; And let us no more look upon <hi>Porſenna,</hi> as the protector of the <hi>Tarquins,</hi> but as their greateſt enemie, becauſe he hath abandoned them. Let us believe my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, that if this Prince had no vertue, the <hi>Romans</hi> would not have remitted us in his power. And moreover if it ſhould come to paſs that he have not ſo much as he ought, to treat us as he ſhould; We ſhall alwaies have enough, to have our recourſe to death, rather then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a life unworthie of what we are. let us go then my companions, let us go and ask from that Prince, the recompence of our flight: He hath been here a long enough time, within the territories of <hi>Rome,</hi> to have learned, that vertue ſhould be loved and rewarded, in his verie enemies: he hath freelie pardoned <hi>Mutius,</hi> who attempted his life; Yet it will be eaſier for him to forget our flight, and grant us the favour, of ſending us back to our parents. It belongs to you now <hi>Porſenna,</hi> to tell me if I have had reaſon to perſwade theſe gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Virgins to truſt themſelves to your goodneſs; For me, if I were not concerned in the thing, I would counſel you to uſe it thus. For it is not onlie glorious to you, to have been enemie of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and to be at preſent their Allay: But it ſhall alſo be more to you, if you undertake to diſpute vertue with them. That is the thing wherein it will be brave to outdoe them: For that ſort of war, hath this particular priviledge, that the conquered as well as the Victorious, ſhall alwaies acquire abundance of glorie. The ſole deſire of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting at ſuch occaſions, is more advantageous, then the gaining of a battle. undertake then <hi>Porſenna</hi> this famous combate, truſt your ſelf abſolutl; to the <hi>Romans</hi> faith, and ſend us back to our parents.</p>
               <p>Methinks they have keeped their word to you in a Generous enough manner, not to permit you to queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: Yet that doth not hinder, But you ſhall do a brave action, if you reſtore us to libertie. But to give libertie to <hi>Roman</hi> Virgins, and to Virgins, who can deſpiſe death to ſhun infamie, is to give them more then Kingdoms, more then Empires, and more then life. That place of Hiſtorie, ſhall be ſo advantageous to you, that your reign ſhall have nothing more brave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="198" facs="tcp:31892:107"/>means, you ſhall have fewer hoſtages in your Camp, but you ſhall have more intelligence in <hi>Rome.</hi> We do not pray to the Gods here, but only for our country: But in <hi>Rome</hi> we ſhall daylie offer them vows, for your glorie. You ſhall be our protector, and without our having been ſlaves, we ſhall not forbear to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you with the ſame ſentiments, as if you had broken our chains, and as if you had relieved us from ſervitude. Reſnſe not <hi>Porſenna,</hi> the glorious title of our Liberator, becauſe we earnſtlie deſire to give it you. Perhaps you will ſay to me, that we abuſed you by our flight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we would not have fled, but for having feared you, and becauſe we looked upon you as a Prince cruel, barbarous and Tirranick: But remember <hi>Porſenna</hi> that the vertue of Women ſhould be ſcrupulous and timide, They ſhould almoſt look upon all People, as if they were their enemies: And becauſe by cuſtome armes are forbidden to them, fear muſt ſerve in ſtead of prudence: And it was more worthie for them to flee, or to have died a little too ſoon, then to have lingered, or to have lived a little too long. Further, we had evil thoughts of you, becauſe we did not know you, but by the name of the Protector of Tirranie, and I declare to you preſentlie, that I do not yet know who you are: Speak then <hi>Porſenna,</hi> that I may thereby know you: Remember that you are within the fight of <hi>Rome,</hi> that you have all the <hi>Romans</hi> for your ſpectators; that you are to ſpeak to Virgins, who can alwaies live or die with glorie; That ſame attends our arreſt to publiſh it over all the Earth; That the Gods who ſee you, do alreadie hold Crowns to put upon your head, if you can ſurpaſs your reſentment; And overcome the vertue of our Fathers and ours, by truſting to them, and by granting us our libertie.</p>

The injurie that I have receved, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires not the bloud of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> to blot it out: That will not be the way, of reſtoring <hi>Anthonies,</hi> affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to me, to declare warr aginſt him for my ſake: On the conrtare, it will be ane authoriſing his fault and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancie; Becauſe it is certain, that I ſhould merit the treatment I receve, if for baniſhing of me from his heart, I ſhould baniſh me from his houſe, and ſhould joyn with his enemies partie. I know that I am a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and that I have the honor of being your ſiſter, but I alſo know, that I am <hi>Anthonies</hi> wife; That his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts ought to be mine; And that though He hath not for me, all the affection that He is oblidged to have; My own vertue does not permit me to deſpenſe with that which I owe to him: And if I uſe it any other way, it will be the acknowledging of <hi>Clopatra,</hi> for <hi>Anthonys</hi> lawfull wife, and a voluntarie yeelding a quality to her, which ſhe cannot take from me. Let me then conceal my greif and teares in the houſe of my husband: My Lord, let me then abſconde my affliction, and my reſentment: And if it be true, that my intereſts are dear to you, as you have alwayes teſtified to me; Aſſiſt me in excuſeing <hi>Anthonie,</hi> to the Senate. Tell that this Love is too violent, to laſt long time: And that as the great Jnlius <hi>Ceſar,</hi> had ſtrength enough to diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the charmes of that fair <hi>Egyptian</hi> which had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed him: <hi>Anthonie,</hi> having the ſame feeblneſſe,

But in fine, my Lord, ſee that that Love be not the beginning of war: Remember that glorious day wherein my tears made the armes fall from the hands of the two greateſt <hi>Emperors</hi> that ever was. you was then environed with your Legions; your armie was all in a readyneſſe to fight; The three hundered ſhips which <hi>Anthonie</hi> led, were in ſight of your troupes: Their was then to be ſeen in both parties, that fervour, which the ſight of enemies gives in ſuch encounters; Deſire of victorie was in the hearts of all the ſouldiers: They had alreadie conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the richneſſe of the bootie; Eagles were ſeen againſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>agles; <hi>Romans</hi> agitnſt <hi>Romans;</hi> Citizens againſt Gitizens; Freinds againſt freinds: Relationes againſt relations: And in fine to ſay all, the battle of <hi>Pharſalta,</hi> did make nothing more terrible to the ſight, then what my eyes ſaw at that time. However though <hi>Anthonie,</hi> appeared the agreſſor, becauſe he came to attaque you? My tears, my reaſons, and my prayers ſurpaſſed your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment. You embraced <hi>Anthonie,</hi> in ſtead of fighting of him: You receved him as the husband of your ſiſter, and not as your enemie: And theſe two puiſſante ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which you had raiſed to deſtroy your ſelves ſerved but to give you reciprocall marks of a perfect intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. For you have not forgot, that <hi>Anthonie,</hi> gave you a hundred Galies, and twentie Brigantines: Alſo that you gave him two Legions: And beſides that, you granted alſo to me for him a thouſand of your beſt ſouldiers. Think you, my Lord, that that firſt victorie, doth not make me hope for a ſecond. You love me as much to day, as you Loved me at that time? The ſight of your enemies does not acerberate your reſentment: You have no Legions about you, who preſle you to give them a new ſubject to their courage: You are alone, you are unarmed, I am unfortunate and afflicted, and my tears, my reaſones, and my prayers, ſhould alſo be more powerful with you, then they were that day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is nothing in agitation but my intereſt.</p>
               <p>Further, it is caſier to hinder ones ſelf from taking up of armes, then to quit them: And it ſhould have been then more difficult for you, to have made peace with <hi>Anthonie,</hi> then it can be to you now to begin a warr: It is <hi>Anthonies,</hi> paſſion, and not his perſon that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:31892:111"/>muſt be fought againſt; And for that effect, I ought to endure his unconſtancy without complaining, I ought to preſerve my heart for him, though he robbes me of his; I ought to have compaſſion of his weakneſs; I ought to have reſpect for him, though he deſpiſes me; I ought to dwell in his houſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o long as he does me the favour, to ſuffer me there; And to ſay all, I ought to oppoſeyou, every time that you would oblidge me to doethings which might be diſhonorable to me. If <hi>Anthonie,</hi> would deſire to carrie me on to a deſign of hurting you I ſhould oppoſe him, as I doe oppoſe you: And with the ſame armes wherewith I fight you now, would I fight his unjuſtice and his obſtinacie. Yes my Lord I ſhall alwayes be <hi>Ceſars</hi> ſiſter, and <hi>Anthonies</hi> wife: And let fortune doe what it will, I ſhall never do any thing unworthie of theſe two glorious qualities. pardon me then, if I tell you boldlie, that I will not go out of my Husbands houſe, unleſs he command me; And if it ſhould alſo come to paſs, that <hi>Cleopatras</hi> Love, doe even carrie him to ſuch ane irregularity, as to ordain me to quit it: I ſhall abandon it with ſhedding as few tears as is poſſible for me, for fear that the compaſſion that will be had for me, doe not augment the hatred that will be had to him. Behold my Lord what <hi>Octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vias</hi> thoughts are and what they ſhall allwayes be. And moreover, to ſpeak rationallie, <hi>Anthonie,</hi> is not ane ordinarie man: The great qualities: which are in him, merits the excuſe of his imbecillity: And the brave actiones which he hath donein the wars ſhould doubtleſs obtain from the equity of all men, ſome indulgence for theſe which love makes him doe. The affection that he alwayes had for the great <hi>Julius Ceſar,</hi> ſhould oblidge you not condemn him ſlightlie: Becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſone by adoption, and his lawful ſucceſſor, me thinks you ſhould be heir to his inclinationes and to his friends, as well as to his riches. When <hi>Anthonie,</hi> fought for <hi>Julius Ceſoer,</hi> He fought for you, you ought to reward him for all that he did for him: For in ſine, of all <hi>Ceſares</hi> debts, the moſt juſt and moſt glorious to pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, are doubtleſs the good offices which his freinds have rendered to him. Remember what <hi>Anthonie,</hi> did for that Excellent man: it was he who did gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouslie oppoſe <hi>Pompeyes</hi> faction, when it would have had <hi>Ceſar</hi> lay down his armes, and his enemie not lay
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:31892:111"/>down his: He ſpake zealouſlie at that time, and feared not the expoſing of himſelf, to receve an outrage; as in effect he was unworth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lie uſed, in conſideration of that: And was conſtrained to diſguiſe himſelf like a ſlave, to goe and ſeek a refuge, in the Camp of him whom he had protected. But what He did at that time, He did alſo at a hundered others as important; He hath repayed with his blood, and with his perſon, the friendſhip that <hi>Ceſar</hi> did bear to him. He was ſeen ſeverall times to rallie his troupes, bring them back to the battle, and render them victorious, when they were almoſt ready to be conquered. He was ſeen at the battle of <hi>Pharſalia,</hi> command the right wing of <hi>Ceſars</hi> armie fight for glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lrie, and expoſe his life, to ſecure in his hands, that ſoveraign Power, which at laſt hath come to yours. Further, if he fought for <hi>Ceſar,</hi> dureing his life, he hath alſo cauſed <hi>Ceſar</hi> conquer after his death: His eloquence did that, which the valour of anie other had not power to doe: For you are not ignorant, that without that fervent zeal that made him ſpeak, the <hi>Roman</hi> people dared not to teſtifie, how near the blood of <hi>Ceſar</hi> did touch them. They would have bein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with ſhedding of tears, and would not have ſet fire to the houſes of his murtherers. You ſee then my Lord, in what manner he erected the firſt ſtepp, by which you obtained the power that you have? But if after what he hath done for <hi>Ceſar,</hi> it be permitted to put in account, what he hath done for the common cauſe, both againſt <hi>Caſſjus,</hi> and againſt <hi>Brutus;</hi> You will find that he was alwaies their conqueror: And that in ſome encounters wherein you was not in condition to fight he was as advantageous to you, as he was to your freinds: Becauſe that without his valor, they ſhould have doubtleſſe gained a victorie, which perhaps would have put them in condition of not being anie more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered. I well know my Lord, that ſince that you have not ſtill being equallie well together: And that this noble jealouſie that inſeparablie followes them, who are lovers of glorie, and who aſpyre at great things, hath altered your freindſhip: But if I be not miſtaken, this kind of hatred, ſhould not ſo much as reach the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: Ane enemie muſt be excelled in grandour of courage and in generoſitie: He muſt be oppoſed, if
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:31892:112"/>he attempts to deſtroy us: But for particular cauſes the publick repoſe muſt never be troubled: nor for everie flight reaſon, ſhould a warr be begun, whoſe ſucceſſe is allwaies dubious. Hatred is a paſſ on for particulars: And if it be permitted to perſones who have the ſupreame power to have it, it ſhould be a hatred of vice, of ſlaverie, and of infamie; Other wayes if they fight not againſt that paſſion, and if they let it bear ſway with them, they ſhall doubtleſſe be capable of all ſort of unjuſtice. For revenging their own injuries, they will make no difficultie to violate the lawes of men, to forget naturall equitie, to infringe the juſteſt Lawes, to deſtroy their countrey, and to deſpiſe the power of the gods. Behold, my Lord the diſorders that hatred may cauſe ſometimes in the moſt ſteaddie mind; And to hinder you from falling in the like misfortune con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider a little what ane exceſſe of love makes the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunat <hi>Anthonie</hi> doe. Think you my Lord, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>atred can give you juſter ſentiments? And that jealouſie, if I were capable of it, permitts me to act with leſſe violence? No my Lord, theſe three paſſiones being put in oppoſition to one another, as they will be in this encounter, will be capable of deſtroying the whole earth. Doe not engadge your ſelf then, in ſuch a perverſe deſigne; but how ever if you will revenge your ſelf of <hi>Anthonie,</hi> abandone him to his own judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to the charms of <hi>Cleopatra.</hi> Let him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that fair conqueſt in repoſe: And doe not fear that he will attempt to oppoſe yours, if you let him enjoy that peaceablie. But my Lord conſider if you doe jrritate him, he may parhaps give you much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: <hi>Anthonies</hi> firſt valour is not dead, it is but benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Perhaps it may at laſt rouſe it ſelf with furie: And without quitting the paſſion, that reignes in his ſoul, he may oppoſe your deſigns, with all the fervour that man can have, who fights to defend himſelf, to revenge himſelf. for his own glorie, and to preſerue his Miſtreſs. Make not then a redoubtable enemie of ane unfortunat freind: I conjure you never to let me ſee you undertake a warr, wherein it will not be permitted me, to have the power of wiſhing you to gain the victorie. Conſider I pray you in what condition my ſoul will find it ſelf, if I ſhould again ſee you ready to come to ſhedding
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:31892:112"/>of blood. But with this cruel difference from the firſt that that was but for love to you, and that this will be for love of me. No, No, revenge not the injurie that is done to me, and ſeek not a remedie worſe then the deſeaſe. The ſole thought of ſeing my brother and my husband, ready to give death to each other for my ſake, tranſports me with horror; I almoſt know no more what I ſay: And in ſo greata trouble I am ready to give my blood and my life, to preſerve yours and that of <hi>Anthonies:</hi> But ſince you would naither ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of my blood nor of my life, ſee my tears with with compasſion; At leaſt hear my prayers and my ſighs; And ſince by your command, I am <hi>Anthonies</hi> wife: Doe not command in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Look I pray you, round about this Urne, upon <hi>Germanicus</hi> his ſix Children all clouded with tears: Take pittie of their youth, and of their misfortune: And fear with me that by their father his abandoning of them, he hath not taken from them all their vertue. If his life had been ſo long, as rationallie it might have been, his example, if they had had perverſe inclinations, would have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies led them to good: But to day, in the condition that things are, who ſhall he be who can inſtruct them? Who ſhall he be who will correct them? Who is he who will lead them into the War? Who is he who will make them hate Vice, and love Vertue? I doubt not but that <hi>Tiberius</hi> will have for them, the ſame ſentiments which he had for their father: For his inclinations are not eaſilie changed: But ſince the Emperour did not hinder him from having enemies, envyers, perſecutors, and from dying by poiſon, it may alſo be, that the care he will take for their education, will not be profitable: And I wiſh to heaven that all I apprehend of <hi>Caligula</hi> do not come to paſs: Let us <hi>Romans,</hi> let us leave what is to come under the providence of the Gods: And let us onlie ſpeak of the misfortunes which are befallen us.

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:31892:116"/>It was with theſe ſame Souldiers that he revenged the defate of <hi>Varus,</hi> that he did retake the Eagle of the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Legion; that he paſt thorow the <hi>Brustores;</hi> that he wholly ranſacked all that is betwixt the Rivers <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa</hi> and <hi>Luppia;</hi> and unſatisfied with teſtifying his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in the Wars, he did let his piety be ſeen as well as his courage. For coming to the ſame place where <hi>Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> had been defated, and where there is yet to be ſeen an infinite number of blanched bones, ſcattered upon the plain, or cumulated together in great heaps, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Souldiers fled or fought: Where I ſay there is yet to be ſeen ſhivered launces, and quantities of other broken armes, horſes heads tied to trees; altars whereon the <hi>Barbarians</hi> had immolated the <hi>Tribunes</hi> and the <hi>Centurians;</hi> where they who had eſcaped from the defate, ſhewed the places, where the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders had received their deaths wounds; where the Eagles had been taken, where <hi>Varrus</hi> had received his firſt wounds; and where quickly after he died by his own hand.

But the maximes of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and theſe of <hi>Germanicus</hi> were

Render to him at leaſt the ſame honours, which he gave to <hi>Varrus</hi> his Souldiers; and becauſe he had courage enough to revenge their death, be you at leaſt ſo generous as to mourn for his. Nevertheleſs let us not leave him any longer in the ſhad of this terrifying field all covered with dead bodies: let us behold him in hisconqueſts: let us lock how the Valiant <hi>Arminius</hi> dares not wait for him: and let us ſee with what skill, what conduct, and with what courage he purſued and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſo generous an enemy. <hi>Germanieus</hi> at that time joyned prudence with valour: And ſurpriſing the <hi>Cattaneans,</hi> when they leaſt thought of him, he ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacked all their countrey: took the town of <hi>Martium</hi> Capitoll of the Province. He ſet it on fire, he had many priſoners in it: And after he had carried terrour eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie where, he retook the way to the Rhine, without the enemies dareing to follow him. From thence he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived <hi>Segeſta,</hi> which they of his countrey hold beſidg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in favours of <hi>Arminius,</hi> who afterward, by a trom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie of war, ſeemed rather to flee, then to retire.

Never were enemies ſeen defend themſelves more obſtinatly: It ſeemed that they did not ſometimes flee, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with the greater courage to fight: The defaiting of their troupes did on lie augment their courage: And the nearer they ſeemed to be conquered, the more they

He has beenſeen after ſhip-wrack, repay to all the Souldiers who eſcaped; what the ſtorme had made them loſs: He was ſeen while he livedſerve his greateſt enemies: And that which is moreſtrange, and more mervalous, he is dead, without having ſaid anie thing, againſt the chief of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie, that was done againſt his life: And he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with having prayed his friends, to cauſe puniſh the complices. Me thinks <hi>Romans,</hi> that it is the leaſt thing, can be granted to the Aſhes of <hi>Anthonies</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his grand-son, and of <hi>Agrippinaes</hi> husband. yes <hi>Romans,</hi> if <hi>Tiberius</hi> were chief of that conſpiration, (which none among you dare ſay) that

All they who concern themſelves with doing of horrid Villanies have alwaies uſed to let the executioners of their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deſigns be loſt, to the end that they be not ſuſpected. <hi>Piſo</hi> hath alreadie had the audacity, to ſay to <hi>Marſus Vibius,</hi> by an inſolent rallerie, that ſeems to be like a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom I name not, becauſe I have more reſpect then he; <hi>that he would come to</hi> Rome <hi>to juſtifie the death of</hi> Germanicus, <hi>when the Praetor informed of the poiſons had ſummoned there all the criminals, and all the accuſers.</hi> Yes <hi>Romans,</hi> I tell you again, that whatſoever way <hi>Germanicus</hi> was put to death, <hi>Piſo</hi> ſhould die; And I have ſo much hope from the prudence of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> that I doubt not but <hi>Piſo</hi> ſhall die: And that in ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the death of <hi>Germanicus</hi> will be revenged. But to obtain this ſatisfaction, employ your tears and prayers: Let the name of <hi>Germanicus</hi> be heared over all: Do not encloſe your ſorrow in the tomb of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> with thoſe pittifull Reliques which we are carieing to it. Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me <hi>Romans;</hi> Let us go to the Senat and demand juſtice for <hi>Germanicus:</hi> Let us repreſent that it will be diſgracefull to it, not to revenge the death of a man, for whom Triumphant Arches were erected; Who was ſeen enter <hi>Rome,</hi> in a Triumphant Chariot; And who paſt among all Nations, and among the <hi>Barbarians</hi> themſelves, for the moſt accompliſhed among mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals. Let us not uſe charmes nor enchantments, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying our enemies, as they have done to deſtroy <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manicus,</hi> Let us not revenge his death by the ſame armes which cauſed it; let us truſt to the juſtice of the Gods, to the prudence of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> and to the Senats authoritie: The juſtice that we deſire cannot be refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us. You Souldiers, who have followed him, ask the blood of <hi>Piſo,</hi> to revenge the death of your Captain, Recount to the Senate the perills wherein you did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie him, ſhow the wounds you received in the fights where he was: Tell truelie the things which you was witneſſes of: And in fine, deſire, that the death of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:31892:119"/>the Father of his Legions and your Generall may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged. You generous Citizens who hear me, deſire boldlie that the death of <hi>Germanicus</hi> may be revenged: Remember what he was; Remember his vertue, his modeſtie, his goodneſs, his courage, his liberalitie, and his moderation. Say that he was the <hi>Modell</hi> by which you hoped to regulate the lives of your children, &amp; to hinder them from following the perniciousexam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which they ſee everie day.

And deſire at leaſt, that they may revenge on the perſon of the treacherous <hi>Piſo,</hi> him who is taken from you. in fine, who ever you be that hears my voice, employ yours, in asking this equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vengeance.

But if our imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation demonſtrat things to us as they are, if our ſpirit underſtand them perfectlie; And if our memorie ſerve us as it ought: By conſequence our judgement cannot erre?

               <p>I will not lead you unto places where you ſhall ſee nothing agreeable: I will not have you ſpend your life in importunate inquires after ſecrets which are not to be found: I will not have you unprofitablie employ all your ſpirits to know the place whereto the winds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires after they have made ſhipwrackes: And in fine I will not have you conſume the reſt of your dayes, in divyning indiſſerently upon all things, I love your repoſe, your glorie and your beautie equallie: I doe not wiſh to you ſuch ſtudies, as make the complexion yellow, the eyes hollow, the countenance ghaſtlie, which make wrinekles on the forehead; and which make the humor melancholie and unquiet. I will not have you flee ſocietie nor light: But I onlie will have you follow me to the banks of Parnaſſus. It is there <hi>Erinna,</hi> that I will conduct you; it is there that you ſhall ſurpaſs me, how ſoon you arrive at it: It is there, that you ſhall acquire beauty, which time, yeares, ſeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones, old Age, nor Death it ſelf can robb you of: And in fine it is there, that you ſhall know perfectlie, that our Sex it capable of every thing that it would under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. It may be you will ſay to me, that by my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to engadge you to poeſie, I do not keep my word to you: Becauſe in the deſcriptions which are given of them who make verſes, it ſeemes that beautie cannot correſpond with the grimaces which itcauſes
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:31892:124"/>them make; But know <hi>Erinna,</hi> that this is but ane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of men; who would make us belive that as we ſee them who give oracles troubled by the preſence of the god that makes them ſpeak; The ſame way, poeſie being whollie divyn, troubles them: who practiſe it. But though that were ſo, your eyes ſhall not be leſſe bright: For how ſoon the Oracle is given, the Preiſt is reſtored to his former tranquillity; So ſhall you alſo no ſooner quit the pen, then you ſhall reſind all your premire urbanities: And moreover, I doe not think that you will repleniſh your ſpirits with ſo dooleful images, as may cauſe any forrowful thing reſult in your eyes. You ſhall be abſolute Miſtriſs of the ſubjects you wonld treat of: And of the manic beauties which are in nature; you may choiſe what pleaſes moſt your inclination, the deſcription of a wood, or of a fountain, the compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ints of a lover and of a Miſtris; Or the Elogie of ſome vertue will give you ample enough ſubject, to make the talents appear which heaven hath endued your perſon with. You are born with ſuch glorious advantages, as that you will be ungrate to theſe who have given you them, if you know not the good uſe of them. Perhaps you will ask of me, if it be not ſufficiently glorious for a fine woman, that all the brave ſpirits of her time; make verſes in praiſe of her, without that ſhe medle, to make her own Pictur her ſelf: I ſay you may ask me, if her glorie be not better eſtabliſhed this way then the other; But I have this a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Believe me <hi>Erinna,</hi> it is much better to give immortalitie to others, then to receive it from any other: And to find ones own glorie with themſelves, them to hear of it elſewhere the pictures which ſhall be this way made of you perhaps ſhall not paſſe one day with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, but as tablets made for pleaſure. The Poets imagination, will be more admired then your beauty; And the Copies in fine ſhall paſſe fore the original. But if from your own hand, you doe leave ſome ſignes of what you are, you ſhall ſtill live with honor, in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories of all men; They of your age who have praiſed

Conſider alſo again I conjure you, how feeble and undureable is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation that is founded upon beautie. Of all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit numbers of beautiful women, who doubtleſs have lived in theſe ages which preceded ours, we have ſcarſe heard two or three onlie ſpoken of: And in theſe very ages, we ſee the glorie of moſt men, ſolidlie eſtabliſhed by the wreatings which they have left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them; let not <hi>Erinna,</hi> tyme, old age and death robb you of any thing but Roſes; And not take away all your beautie. Triumph over theſe enemies in everie good thing: Put your ſelf in condition to ſuſtain the glorie of our Sex by your example: make our common enemies avouch that it is as eaſie for us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, with the force of our ſpirits, as with the beauty of our eyes: Let your judgement appear, by deſpiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſottiſneſs, that the vulgare will ſay of your reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution: Let all the earth ſee ſuch fine tablets of your imagination; ſuch noble efforts of your ſpirit; Such brave effects of your memorie; And ſuch good teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of your judgement; that you alone may have the advantage, of having reeſtabliſhed the glorie of all women. Doe not contemn then what I ſay to you: But if for a falſe ſhame, you will not reſolve to follow me; And will make all your glorie conſiſt in your Beautie you ſhall lament while you are alive the loſſe of that beautie. You ſhall be ſpoken of, as if you had been of ane other age, And you ſhall then find that I had reaſon to ſay to you this day, what I think I have ſaid formerly in ſome of my verſes.</p>
